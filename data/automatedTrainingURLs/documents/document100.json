She was the first one in her family to go to university, graduating with a business degree in her mid-20s as a mature-age student whilst parenting her two young kids as a single mum. After working as a public servant for nearly a decade, Lyndee decided to go on a trip of a lifetime when she was 40-years old - riding her motorbike from her home in Wollongong to Darwin. It was a trip that would change her life and see her move to Curtin Springs Station - a million-hectare cattle and tourism enterprise, not far from Uluru in Australia's red centre.Looking back at taking that first motorbike trip 20 years ago, Lyndee had no idea how the holiday would set the course of the rest of her life.This episode sponsor is the Graziher 2022 Boarding School Guide.

  "MAKING A DECISION ABOUT your children's education can be a struggle.Boarding school is something that many children from rural, regional and remote areas experience in their lives. It can be one of the greatest experiences - making lifelong friends; getting a great education; and being offered amazing extra-curricular activities such as sports and cultural activities. ",
  "Making a decision about your child's education can be difficult, so we have created a guide to help make that hard decision a little easier for those of you who are facing it.In our current Autumn issue, there is a lift-out for you to read. It features some fantastic schools and expo information. Along with some insights about boarding school from our regular contributors Jane Smith, Jayne Cuddihy and Grace Quast.Or head to Graziher.com.au for our digital Graziher Boarding School Guide, it has extended stories on all the schools featured a directory and direct links to all school websites.

All that is going on around us; in our backyard and afar. ",
  "A lot to take in and contextualise within our own lives.In the last few years there has been so many unprecedented's, worst ever's and an evolution of world events that were acknowledged as absurdity only a few years ago.I've found that gaining a deeper understanding helps.Our guest today is ABC Journalist and Macadamia farmer Bronwyn Herbert, who lives on high ground just 10 kilometres from Lismore.Over the course of the last 10 days her life, and the lives of her community have been turned on their face. Brown, murky, debris filled flood waters, 2 metres higher than the highest ever recording, crushed her community and their days are now filled with the chaos of finding minders for children, so adults can work, and if they're not working they're helping someone, strangers to clean up, or wash clothes or cook meals, or share a cool drink.While you listen to Bronwyn's story have a think about a new initiative Graziher is setting up in response to the QLD and northern NSW floods.The Graziher Bush Telegraph will be set up to help flood effected businesses get back on their feet. ",
  "We know that when the waters reside, businesses will need the help of the Graziher community for many months to come. So we will be launching the Bush Telegraph in the next issue of Graziher to get the word out. Contact Sally via email to find out how we can help. Her email address is sally@graziher.com.au.

She is a mother, philanthropist, change-maker and country girl born and bred.Alongside her husband Andrew Forrest of Fortescue Metals Group, Nicola is the co-chair and co-founder of Minderoo Foundation and a director of the Tattarang Group.She campaigns to better the lives of children and the vulnerable, but also drives advances in the arts and community sectors and for the equality of women.Her story is many things; it's aspirational and I hope you will find it inspirational but most of all, and the reason we wanted to tell Nicola's behind-the-scenes story is because it's relatable. ",
  "Nicola Forrest could have been any one of us; she grew up on a farm in Spicers Creek in central west New South Wales, had a penchant for agriculture and on travelling to remote north Queensland for a sniff of adventure, she fell in love with the Outback and eventually Andrew Forrest.This is a story of Nicola Forrest as a young girl and as a mother. And a warning this episode does speak about the loss of a child. ",

Ginny lives on a property near Albury with her husband, Rhys and their four young children, Oscar, 6, four year old Eva, three year old Elke and four month old Tully.Ginny, who was named the Caroline Jones Women in Media Young Journalist's Award in 2019 and last year named as one of 21 women who defined 2021 by Vogue Magazine, is breaking completely new ground with her fight against child sexual abuse.The journalist has recently launched an investigative podcast series alongside The Australian newspaper and reporter Steve Jackson, called My Sister's Secrets. It's an at-times harrowing and deeply difficult listen. But it's also courageous and compelling, as Ginny explores the events leading up to the abuse she and her older sister, Ally experienced as children, by their step grandfather. Ally later experienced a separate alleged assault as a teenager, and died in June 2020 from a drug overdose.These are stories we'd rather weren't real. ",
  "But they are, and Ginny's bravery is extraordinary. Her ability to look the ugly truth in the eye and speak about her lived experience is sending ripples across Australia. ",
  "And she's creating a safe space for other survivors to come forward and seek the help and justice they deserve.

Maggie's already doing it and I'm get to get back on. So I really enjoy our working relationship. \"More than that, in 2011 I think was, when Maggie's story went to air on ABC TV's Australian Story I was so touched, like so many Australians, in her bravery about talking about what had happened to her and her family. The loss of her husband at such a young age to mental illness followed closed by the death of her mother from cancer. ",
