  "Login Register Nike announced last Thursday (18 January) that it had signed its second major wind contract with Avangrid renewables to source 86MW from the Karankawa Wind Farm near Corpus Christi in Texas. Scheduled for completion by summer 2019, the 286MW capacity wind farm will produce enough energy annually to power more than 75,000 average US households. \u201cThis agreement enables us to source 100% renewable energy across our owned or operated facilities in North America,\u201d Nike\u2019s chief sustainability officer and vice president of the company\u2019s Innovation Accelerator, Hannah Jones said. \u201cInvesting in renewable energy is good for athletes, the planet and for business.\u201d Half way there The power purchase agreement means that Nike is now more than half way to its commitment of sourcing 100% renewable energy across owned and operated facilities worldwide. The commitment, agreed as part of Nike\u2019s involvement with the RE100 initiative, has a 2025 deadline. Nike has previous power purchase agreements with Avangrid Renewables\u2019, sourcing from three Columbia Gorge-based wind farms.",
  "The agreements deliver 100% renewable energy to Nike\u2019s worldwide headquarters near Beaverton as well as the majority of the company\u2019s Oregon-based facilities. \u201cWorking with partners like Nike who have relentless focus on driving the development and availability of renewable energy is exciting and inspiring,\u201d Avamgrid Renewables\u2019 vice president of origination Barrett Stambler said.",
  "\u201cThis partnership allows us to have a very positive impact in the local communities where we own and operate these wind farms, creating jobs & economic development for rural America and advancing our country\u2019s energy independence.\u201d Alongside the RE100, Nike has joined numerous global initiatives. Nike joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as a global partner, as well as pledging to the \u201cWe Are Still In\u201d declaration to act on climate change, following US President Donald Trump\u2019s revelation that the country would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Last year, Nike joint other major apparel companies in committing to set emission reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative.
