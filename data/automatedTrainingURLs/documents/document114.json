  "Sustainable Energy Powered with AI When it\u2019s software-defined, the electric grid becomes more resilient, affordable, and decarbonized through renewable energy and integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). From digital twins of power plants to AI-driven grid operations to next-generation smart meters capable of real-time control, the power grid of tomorrow will accelerate our energy transition to a more sustainable future. Read industry brief: Top AI Use Cases in Utilities (PDF 48.8 KB) Autonomous Operations With NVIDIA Modulus and NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, power plants can automate manually intensive inspections to improve predictive maintenance, reduce unplanned downtimes, and protect worker health and safety. Global Decarbonization To reach ambitious net-zero emissions goals by 2050, renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, and electric are growing in adoption. AI can dynamically manage these new resources on the grid. Grid Decentralization As more electric vehicles and residential solar panels come online, traditional energy grids will quickly become overloaded and unreliable.",
  "Smart grids, built on software and powered by edge AI, can automate management. Enhancing Energy Efficiency at Every Stage The Software-Defined Smart Grid Managing distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind farms, presents challenges for traditional grids.",
  "Edge AI helps dynamically manage energy resources, predict demand, and allocate supply to enhance grid resiliency. Advances in smart meters\u2014powered by a software-defined smart grid chip based on the NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson\u2122 edge AI platform\u2013deliver greater value to utilities and their customers, while unlocking new opportunities for clean energy companies and third-party market developers. Learn how innovators are redefining meters for a more efficient grid Watch to get a utility executive\u2019s guide to AI and HPC See how utilities are redefining grid operations from the edge Read about Utilidata\u2019s new grid edge advisory board Industrial Digital Twins Global energy enterprises are looking to build industrial digital twins to reduce the unplanned downtime of equipment for maintenance and repairs. The solution uses NVIDIA Modulus, a framework for developing physics-machine learning neural network models, and NVIDIA Omniverse, a physically accurate virtual world simulation and collaboration platform for 3D workflows. By analyzing real-time data to reduce the frequency of planned shutdowns, utilities can maintain worker safety, improve site efficiency, and save billions of dollars per year. Learn how Siemens Gamesa is accelerating the clean energy transition Learn how Siemens Energy is creating a digital twin of a power plant Read about NVIDIA\u2019s digital twin platform for scientific computing Real-Time Power Grid Management Managing loads within large regional grids is complex.",
  "With the emergence of microgrids and nanogrids\u2014small-scale local backup power systems that operate autonomously and integrate distributed energy resources\u2014real-time load balancing and price adjustments are exponentially more complex. With NVIDIA GPUs, utilities can accelerate simulations of power networks at scale, achieve optimal power flow, and rapidly identify grid anomalies.",
  "Daily workloads such as outage scheduling and contingency analysis can also be accelerated. See how utilities are using GPUs to coordinate outage scheduling Watch to learn how AI and HPC can boost system security and control See how GPU-accelerated dynamic modeling is optimizing power grids Grid Predictive Maintenance In the U.S, utilities own 185 million poles and spend tens of millions of dollars each year tracking the status of transformers, fuses, and other attached devices for potential faults. This manually intensive process can take up to a decade, yet the condition of each device is critical to delivering power safely to homes and businesses. By deploying the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform on service trucks, utilities can automate data collection and analysis, including the identification of vegetation growing too closely to power lines. And with NVIDIA Omniverse, enterprises can simulate wildfires using a digital twin to better predict and respond to fires in real time. Read how a utility is tracking distribution lines with computer vision See how GPU-accelerated analytics is mitigating natural disaster risk See how Lockheed Martin is delivering real-time wildfire intelligence Building AI in the Utilities Ecosystem Stay up to date on the latest AI innovations transforming power and utilities.",
