Now, as we enter our third decade of climate action, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting our most ambitious sustainability goal to date: we intend to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 everywhere, at all times.",
  "And we aim to do it by 2030. Our biggest sustainability moonshot yet In 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the fourth consecutive year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Google matched 100 percent of its annual electricity consumption with purchases of renewable energy, bringing nearly 6 gigawatts of new renewable energy online. This achievement involves buying a surplus of renewable energy in regions where solar and wind power are abundant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like the US Midwest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to address the lack of renewable energy in other places \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as Taiwan. Similarly, in some cases we buy additional solar energy during the day to compensate for our use of carbon-intensive energy at night. Our large-scale procurement of renewables has been effective at helping drive down the price of clean energy, encouraging widespread corporate decarbonization goals, and accelerating renewable projects worldwide. But it still leaves places and times where our operations rely on fossil fuels.",
  "That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking the next step to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy. We want to ensure that our electricity demand is met with clean energy every hour of every day, everywhere.",
  "Reaching our goal won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be easy, but climate change demands urgent action. By aiming for round-the-clock clean energy in all our data center operations and office campuses, our goal is to prove that a carbon-free economy is possible for all. And we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it alone. So in September 2021, Google partnered with Sustainable Energy for All and the United Nations to launch the new 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a set of principles and actions that stakeholders across the energy ecosystem can take to adopt, enable, and advance 24/7 CFE as a means to fully decarbonize electricity systems. The Compact already has growing support from stakeholders, including energy buyers and suppliers, governments, system operators, solutions providers, investors, and other organizations on a mission to transform global electricity grids to full decarbonization.

  "Our annual report is a chance for us to reflect on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve achieved, the lessons we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned along the way, and the opportunities and challenges we see ahead.
