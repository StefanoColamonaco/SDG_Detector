  "Questions about growth entrepreneurship abound, and research in this field is still nascent. For those of us who work in developing economies, a critical challenge is that current research mainly draws on data and experiences from developed countries. There is reason to believe that the findings from developed economies are not necessarily transferrable, and, at the very least, they should motivate more in-depth research into the impact, characteristics and drivers of growth entrepreneurship in developing countries. We conducted a preliminary literature review to analyze the state of research on growth entrepreneurship: You can read the full report here. If you know of research that we may have missed, please use the comment field below to bring it to our attention. We would love to know! Also in motion: an inventory of policy instruments used to promote growth entrepreneurship. We hope to have more to say on that topic in a few months."
