" The coefficient of LS is negative and statistically significant,showing that the growth regime is profit-led, which echoes the results of Molero-Simarro (2015). Across all specifications in Table 6, the coefficients of LS are all negative; in particular, the absolute value of the coefficient is greater in Model (6), which means that the growth regime became more profit-led from 2003 to 2012. Model (2) adds the lagged SOE variable, which has a positive and statistically significant effect. This positive effect remains in all specifications. Model (3) adds the contemporaneous SOE variable and SLOW. Model (4) further adds the interaction term. The coefficient of contemporaneous SOE is negative, but statistically insignificant in both Model (3) and (4). The coefficient of the interaction term in Model (4) is positive and statistically significant, meaning that SOEs offset some adverse effects from economic downturns. The result of Model (4) implies that SOEs promote growth in the long run and in economic downturns, although SOEs have no significant contemporaneous effect on growth in normal times. This result remains in Model (5), when control variables are added. These control variables have no statistically significant effect on growth. Model (6) focuses on the period from 2003 to 2012. The result of Model (6) shows that both the long-run effect and the offsetting effect in economic downturns of SOEs become larger"
