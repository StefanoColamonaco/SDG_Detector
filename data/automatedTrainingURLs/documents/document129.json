  "On the other hand, Foucault personally participated in many political demonstrations. Telling is his participation against the war in Vietnam and the letter he wrote calling on the governments to protect rights. According to Lemke (2001) and Biebricher (2012), such actions of Foucault did not mean that he recognized the liberal view on rights as shields. Instead, he used them politically to gain freedom through practice. As Lemke (2011, 3) put it, ‘freedom does not take shape in institutional arrangements or legal texts. Rather, freedom is a practice, and the only way to preserve it is to claim it’. As Foucault himself stated: ‘the freedom of men is never assured by the laws and the institutions that are intended to guarantee them (...). “[F]reedom” is what must be exercised’ (Foucault 1980)."
