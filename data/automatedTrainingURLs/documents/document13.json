  "It is really important that we measure what matters in our economy in addition to all of the traditional measures. Not instead of, but in addition to. I do want to have better ways to measure progress, and to measure the intergenerational consequences of our policies. This commitment presents an important opportunity to address the many critical challenges Australia faces – from housing affordability, to the environment and Indigenous justice and reconciliation. Just as importantly, it is an opportunity for neglected conversations – about what progress means, and what we want from our lives and for future generations. The traditional measures of national progress to which Chalmers was referring are primarily economic indicators: growth, employment, inflation and exports. The biggest headline measure of economic progress is gross domestic product – or the very similar gross national product (used by the US government from 1934 to 1991) – which tallies economic activity by counting the total dollar value of all of goods and services sold in a year."
