  "The Italian Higher Education with Africa Foundation is composed of six prestigious Italian universities that represent an international development co-operation project to support young African talents and promote the growth of local universities. UniBo, along with other Italian universities, is a member of the IHEA Foundation project to strengthen the international collaboration between universities and contribute to forming a multidisciplinary university program by adapting it specifically to the African continent. In Africa, supporting the development of teaching, training, student empowerment, and staff training becomes increasingly urgent by the day. Therefore, one of the Foundation's missions is a programme for young people aimed at providing educational qualifications recognised in Italy and within the European area of education that will grant them access to managerial, academic, or political-administrative careers in the European countries involved. The program also envisages an alumni community that will consolidate the cultural, educational, and training heritage of its countries while strengthening the relations and opportunities for exchange with Italy and the other countries. One of the Foundation's short-term objectives is to support the resilience of African educational systems, starting with a strategic action based on three pillars: a virtual mobility program, and the design of dedicated Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees aimed at shaping a new generation of qualified researchers and teachers. The need for qualified training to support socio-economic development in the African continent emerged even more overwhelmingly during the Covid-19 emergency and, thanks to the prompt response of the universities of the IHEA Foundation, the virtual mobility program began in the first semester of the Academic Year 2020/21."
