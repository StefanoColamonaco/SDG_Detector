  "Many of us, myself included, spend a lot of time focused on challenges that need to be addressed today\u2014in this minute\u2014leaving less time for creativity and longer-range planning. The same is true for many organizations. When businesses are faced with downtime, traditional hardware restrictions, or have to adapt quickly to new changes afoot, it can limit productivity and stifle innovation. What we hear from IT leaders is that digital transformation becomes a reality when they can go from doing their job despite technology limitations to innovating and delivering on priorities because of the technology they\u2019re using\u2014specifically global, cloud-based infrastructure. In this episode, you\u2019ll get a behind-the-scenes look at how three companies are using cutting-edge technologies like high-performance computing, Quantum, and AI to solve complex challenges, power innovation, and generate new kinds of business impact.
