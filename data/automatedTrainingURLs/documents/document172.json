"A University of Massachusetts at Amherst study found that all government spending is not created equal. The most cost-effective ones are building roads, bridges, and other public works. $1 billion spent on public works created 19,795 jobs.5 Public works create jobs because it puts people right to work. The federal government can quickly fund construction projects already in the approval pipeline. It can hire contractors, send money to the states, or hire workers directly. That was one reason why the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ended the Great Recession in 2009.6 It spent $85 billion in shovel-ready construction projects."
