  "This often leads to financial and social discrimination. In order for nations to flourish, equality and prosperity must be available to everyone - regardless of gender, race, religious beliefs or economic status. When every individual is self-sufficient, the entire world prospers. Goal 10 + Unilever We are proud to represent SDG 10 to reduce inequality. In 2021, we announced a set of social commitments to drive action by ensuring that everyone who directly provides goods and services to Unilever earns at least a living wage or income. By 2030, we will spend \u20ac2 billion annually with suppliers owned and managed by people from under-represented groups and equip 10 million young people with the skills to thrive.",
  "We believe that when society thrives it makes Unilever a better, stronger business; ready for the societal changes we are experiencing today - changes that will only accelerate. Without a healthy society, there cannot be a healthy business."
