[+] report. Getty Images\n\n\nGoogle released its seventh consecutive diversity report on Thursday, revealing modest gains in representation for women and people of color, and a disproportionately white, Asian and male workforce. The percentage of black hires in the U.S. grew from 4.8% in 2018 to 5.5% in 2019, a .7% increase. The percentage of black hires in technical roles also grew by .7%, the largest increase in the share of black technical hires since Google first started publishing diversity data. Latinx employees, on the other hand, saw a dip in hiring, dropping from 6.8% in 2018 to 6.6% in 2019. The percentage of Latinx employees in technical roles increased by a mere .2%. ",
  "Female employees didn\u2019t fare much better, dropping from 33.2% of global hires in 2018 to 32.5% in 2019. Over that same time period, the percentage of women hired for technical positions remained at about 25.6%\u2014a far cry from gender parity. ",
  "But hiring only shows one side of the coin, which is why Google began to include attrition rates in 2018. As in previous years, women continued to have a lower than average attrition rate in 2019, while Latinx attrition in the U.S. dipped below the Google average. Attrition was highest for Native Americans and increased significantly for black women. Overall, Google\u2019s workforce representation\u2014defined as hiring minus attrition\u2014saw a slight uptick for most underrepresented groups. Black and Latinx employees represented 9.6% of the U.S. workforce in 2019, up from 9% in 2018, and women represented 32% of Google\u2019s global workforce, up from 31.6%.

",
  "The percentage of black employees in leadership positions didn\u2019t change year-over-year and dropped by .2% for Native American employees. Although the needle has barely budged for women and people of color in tech over the last year, Google has made it a point to invest in diversity programs. ",
  "Through its philanthropic arm, Google.org, the company committed $10 million to support low-income students and students of color in Bay Area STEM classrooms in 2019. Internally, the company has launched smaller initiatives, such as running all job postings through a bias removal tool, which it says has led to an 11% increase in applications from women. And in an effort to retain diverse talent, Google expanded its retention case management program for underrepresented employees who are considering leaving the company. Looking at its most recent diversity figures, however, Google concedes that there is considerable room for improvement. \u201cThe Native American population is one of those areas where we remain flat and so we will continue to invest more focus in 2020 to make sure that we're targeting this population as well,\u201d says Melonie Parker, Google\u2019s chief diversity officer. While she wouldn\u2019t specify what that investment would entail, Parker says that the company is moving forward on its 2020 diversity goals and will continue to focus on representation and creating an inclusive culture companywide. ",
  "She also notes that even the smallest percentage gains represent\u00a0thousands of jobs for underrepresented groups. One area where Google has seen significant progress is in its internship program: Globally, 40% of interns in technical roles were women in 2019 and 24% of U.S. interns were black and Latinx. "
