Situated on the Al Qudra Road, it is the first net-zero energy development in the Emirate of Dubai. The masterplans amalgamate green, energy efficient designs with a people-centric philosophy that includes nature and animals thus ameliorating public space. The development includes 500 villas, 89 apartments and a mixed-use area consisting of offices, retail, healthcare facilities, a nursery and food and beverage outlets. Phase 2 of the development will include a hotel, school and innovation centre. [1] The city was developed by Dubai-based Diamond Developers, whose chairman, Faris Saeed, has stated that much of his inspiration for the development came from UC Davis West Village.",

  "[4] The parking areas are topped by solar shading featuring solar panels that are connected to an electrical grid to supply energy into different sections of the city. [5] Panels are also placed on the roofs of all of the houses. [citation needed] The construction waste is reused to furnish the public spaces.
