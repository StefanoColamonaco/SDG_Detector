It is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, the official wording is: \"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. ",
  "\"[1] The goal has eight targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven indicators. [2]\nThe six \"outcome-oriented targets\" include: Safe and affordable drinking water; end open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene, improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse, increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies, implement IWRM, protect and restore water-related ecosystems. The two \"means of achieving\" targets are to expand water and sanitation support to developing countries, and to support local engagement in water and sanitation management. [3]\nIn 2017, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water and 4.2 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation. [4] Three billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home. ",
  "[4] Two in five healthcare facilities world-wide have no soap and water, or alcohol-based hand rub (2016). [4] The COVID-19 pandemic has made this goal increasingly important. ",
  "[5] However this pandemic could affect the ability of  water utilities to meet this goal by increasing losses on revenues that would otherwise be used to make investments. [6]\nSDG 6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, progress in SDG 6 will improve health (SDG 3) and improve school attendance, both of which contribute to alleviating poverty. In April 2020, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \u201cToday, Sustainable Development Goal 6 is badly off track\" and it \u201cis hindering progress on the 2030 Agenda, the realization of human rights and the achievement of peace and security around the world\".

[8] However few countries have included a human right to water in enforceable legislation. ",
  "Over 2 billion people in the world lack access to water that is free of health risks. [9] By 2017, eighty countries provided access to clean water for more than 99% of their population. ",
  "[10] From 2000 to 2017, the global population that lacked access to clean water decreased from nearly 20% to roughly 10%. [9]\nEnding open defecation will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as behavior change of the population. [11] To meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation, including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. [12] This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector. [13]\nSafe drinking water and hygienic toilets protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment. ",
  "Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target (\"achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all\"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. ",
  "In June 2019, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization released their 138-page report \"Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000-2017: special focus on inequalities. \"[9] The report said that in 2017, 5.3 billion people\u2014representing 71% of the population of the world\u2014used a \"safely managed drinking-water service\u2014one that is \"located on premises, available when needed, and free from contamination\". [9] By 2017, 6.8 billion people\u2014representing 90% of the world's population\u2014used \"at least a basic service\", which included \"an improved drinking-water source within a round trip of 30 minutes to collect water\". [9] However, in 2017, there were still 785 million people who lacked \"even a basic drinking-water service, including 144 million people who [were] dependent on surface water. \"[9] The report said that approximately 2 billion people used a \"drinking water source contaminated with faeces\". [9] The report warned that diseases, including \"diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio\" are transmitted by contaminated water, which cause about 485, 000 diarrhoeal deaths each year. ",
  "[9] It cautioned that 50% of the global population will be \"living in water-stressed areas\" by 2025. [9] As of 2017, 22% of health care facilities in the least developed countries had no water service, with similar numbers lacking sanitation and waste management services. ",
  "[9]\nA review of SDG progress by the UN in 2020 found that \"increasing donor commitments to the water sector will remain crucial to make progress towards Goal 6\". [5] This is why the UN has put in place a unifying initiative that improves support to countries known as SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework. [14]\n\nTargets, indicators and progress[edit]\nFurther information: List of SDG targets and indicators\n World map for Indicator 6.1.1 in 2015: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services[15]\n World map for Indicator 6.2.1a in 2015: Share of population using safely managed sanitation facilities[15]\n World map for Indicator 6.2.1b in 2017: \"Share of the population with basic handwashing facilities on premises\"[15]\nSDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020, and one has no target year. [16] Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators to monitor progress for SDG6. ",
  "[17] The main data sources for the SDG 6 targets and indicators come from the Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 coordinated by UN-Water. [18] Each government must decide how to incorporate them into national planning processes, policies and strategies based on national realities, capacities, levels of development and priorities. ",
  "[18]\nThe six \"outcome-oriented targets\" include: Safe and affordable drinking water; end open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene, improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse, increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies, implement IWRM, protect and restore water-related ecosystems. The two \"means of achieving\" targets are to expand water and sanitation support to developing countries, and to support local engagement in water and sanitation management. [3]\nThe first three targets relate to drinking water supply, sanitation services and wastewater treatment and reuse. [16]\nAn SDG 6 Baseline Report in 2018 found that less than 50 per cent of countries have comparable baseline estimates for most SDG 6 global indicators. [18]:\u200a31\u200a One reason is that many SDG 6 global indicators are new, and most have only limited time series, making it difficult to determine rates of progress. [18]:\u200a31\u200a\n\nTarget 6.1: Safe and affordable drinking water[edit]\nThe full title of Target 6.1 is: \"By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all\". ",
  "[2]\nThis target has one indicator: Indicator 6.1.1 is the \"Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services\". [15]\nThe definition of \"safely managed drinking water service\" is: \"Drinking water from an improved water source that is located on premises, available when needed and free from fecal and priority chemical contamination. ",
  "\"[11]:\u200a8\u200a Between 2000 and 2015, the percentage of global population using safely managed drinking water serviced has increased from 61 to 71 per cent. But this remained unchanged in 2017. In total, 785 million people around the world still lacked basic drinking water service. [19]\nIn 2017, only 71 per cent of the global population used safely managed drinking water. This means that 2.2 billion persons were still without safely managed drinking water in 2017. [5]\nCompared to 2017, 74% of the world's population will have access to safely managed drinking water in 2020. ",
  "This is an improvement over the past, but 2 billion people still do not have access to safe managed drinking water, especially in rural areas and the least developed countries. In 2020, 771 million people still lack access to even basic drinking water services. ",
  "8 out of 10 of these people live in rural areas, and nearly half live in the least developed countries; none of the SDG regions are currently expected to have universal coverage by 2030, and in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people lacking access to safe managed drinking water has increased by more than 40% since 2000. At the current rate of progress, the global target of universal access to safely managed drinking water by 2030 would need to be quadrupled. [20]\n\nTarget 6.2: End open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene[edit]\nThe full title of Target 6.2 is: \"By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. \"[2]\nThis target has one indicator: Indicator 6.2.1 is the \"Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water\". [21]\nThe definition of \"safely managed sanitation\" service is: \"Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite. \"[11]:\u200a8\u200a Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact. ",
  "[11]:\u200a6\u200a\nTargets 6.1 and 6.2 are usually reported on together because they are both part of the WASH sector and have the same custodian agency, the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP). [11]\n\nThe statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation. ",
  "[11]  Unimproved sanitation example: pit latrine without slab in Lusaka, Zambia\nGlobally, the proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2017. Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and East and Southeast Asia recorded the largest increase. In total, there are still 701 million people around the world who still had to practice open defecation in 2017. [19] This number had reduced in 2020 to 673 million persons who practised open defecation. [5]\nAs of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services. [22]\nIn 2017, about 60 per cent of people worldwide have basic hand-washing facilities with soap and water at home. ",
  "However, within the least developed countries, only 38 per cent had such facilities, translating to about 3 billion people still without basic hand washing facilities at home. [19]\nIn 2020, a report by the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development found that \"Billions of people throughout the world still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services and basic handwashing facilities at home, which are critical to preventing the spread of COVID-19\". ",
  "[5] However, this same pandemic has most likely caused a reduction in access to safely managed sanitation. [23]\n\nTarget 6.3: Improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse[edit]\n Ecosan latrine at May Sa\u00b4iri school in Ethiopia\nTarget 6.3 is formulated as \"By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally\". [2] This is also a sanitation-related target, as wastewater treatment is part of sanitation. The target has two indicators:[21]\n\nIndicator 6.3.1: Proportion of domestic and industrial wastewater flows safely treated\nIndicator 6.3.2: Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality\nThe current status for Indicator 6.3.2 is that: \"Preliminary estimates from 79 mostly high- and higher-middle income countries in 2019 suggest that, in about one quarter of the countries, less than half of all household wastewater flows were treated safely. \"[5]\nPreserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable drinking water. A man selling a drinking water\nTarget 6.4: Increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies[edit]\nTarget 6.4 is formulated as \"By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. ",
  "\"[2]\nThis target has two indicators:[21]\n\nIndicator 6.4.1: Change in water-use efficiency over time\nIndicator 6.4.2: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources\nThe current situation regarding water stress was summarized as follows: \"In 2017, Central and Southern Asia and Northern Africa registered very high water stress \u2013 defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources \u2013 of more than 70 per cent\". This is followed by Western Asia and Eastern Asia, with high water stress of 54 per cent and 46 per cent, respectively. ",
  "[5]\n\nTarget 6.5: Implement IWRM[edit]\nTarget 6.5 is formulated as: \"By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. \"[2]\nThe two indicators include:[21]\n\nIndicator 6.5.1 Degree of integrated water resources management\nIndicator 6.5.2 Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation\nA review in 2020 stated that: \"In 2018, 60 per cent of 172 countries reported very low, low and medium-low levels of implementation of integrated water resources management and were unlikely to meet the implementation target by 2030. \"[5]\nThe same review stated that: \"According to data from 67 countries, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017\u20132018. Only 17 countries reported that all of their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements. \"[5]\n\n Kathleen Lake, Kluane National Park and Reserve  Yukon, Canada\nTarget 6.6: Protect and restore water-related ecosystems[edit]\nTarget 6.6 is: \"By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. \"[2]\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 6.6.1 is the \"Change in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time\". ",
  "[21]\nIt is expected that the adverse effects of climate change can decrease the extent of freshwater bodies, thereby worsening ecosystems and livelihoods. [5]\n\nTarget 6.a: Expand water and sanitation support to developing countries[edit]\nTarget 6.a is: \"By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. ",
  "\"[2]\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 6.a.1 is the \"Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan\". [21]\nIn 2015, global ODA allocations to the water sector totalled us $8.6 billion, including ensuring basic water supply and sanitation, and improving agricultural water resources and hydropower. However,80% of countries fail to meet water and sanitation targets because of insufficient funding [6]. SDG 6 is not going well because of poor policy implementation, staff shortages, inadequate funding and the limited impact of aid money when consistent long-term investments are not put into place. [24] Technological innovation and more effective management are the foundations for advancing SDG 6 in the context of aid funding shortfalls.Therefore, reducing capital expenditure can save a lot of costs. For rural areas in developing countries, it is necessary to use appropriate materials, optimize procurement and eliminate middlemen[7]. ",
  "In 2019, a document by the UN found that: \"Following several years of steady increases and after reaching $9 billion in 2016, official development assistance (ODA) disbursements to the water sector declined by 2 per cent from 2016 to 2017. However, ODA commitments to the water sector jumped by 36 per cent between 2016 and 2017, indicating a renewed focus by donors on the sector. ",
  "\"[25]\nOne year later in April 2020 it was stated that \"ODA disbursements to the water sector increased to $9 billion, or 6 per cent, in 2018, following a decrease in such disbursements in 2017\". [5]\nOver 2 billion people lack properly managed drinking water. An additional 1.6 billion are subjects of poor sanitation. If the status quo persists, the world will not have enough water to meet demand by 2030 hence making it impossible to meet SDG 6- safe drinking water and sanitation for all. Climate change is also making the situation of water availability worse as it negatively impacts on world water systems through increased incidents of drought, floods and rainfall unreliability. To overcome the problem of water crisis, the Global Water Security & Sanitation Partnership (GWSP) collaborates with several countries to make water available to its citizen. ",
  "In 2020, GWSP collaborated with the Dominican Republic in the province of Espaillat renovate and adopt innovative ways of water collection and treatment where the water treatment system has been dysfunctional since 2004. This has improved sanitation, hygiene and availability of clean drinking water. ",
  "Target 6.b: Support local engagement in water and sanitation management[edit]\nTarget 6.b is: \"Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. \"[2]\nIt has one indicator: Indicator 6.b.1 is the \"Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management\". [21]\n\nCustodian agencies[edit]\nCustodian agencies are in charge of reporting on the following indicators:[11][18]\n\nIndicator 6.1.1 and 6.2.1: Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP). The JMP is a joint program of UNICEF and WHO and compiles data to monitor progress of Target 6.1 and Target 6.2. Indicator 6.3.1: UN-Habitat and WHO\nIndicator 6.3.2: Global Environment Monitoring System for Freshwater (GEMS/Water), International Centre for Water Resources and Global Change (UNESCO-IHP); Federal Institute of Hydrology, Germany; University College Cork, Ireland\nIndicators 6.4.1 and 6.4.2: FAOSTAT - AQUASTAT\nIndicator 6.5.1: United Nations Environment Programme-DHI Centre\nIndicator 6.5.2: UNECE and UNESCO-IHP\nIndicator 6.6.1: United Nations Environment Programme, World Conservation Monitoring Centre, International Water Management Institute (IWMI)\nIndicators 6.a.1 and 6.b.1: UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS)\nChallenges[edit]\nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the urban poor living in the slums with little or no access to clean water. [26] [27]The pandemic has shown the importance of sanitation, hygiene and adequate access to clean water to prevent diseases. ",
  "According to the World Health Organization, handwashing is one of the most effective actions one can take to reduce the spread of pathogens and prevent infections, including the COVID-19 virus. [28]\nThe world is being asked to wash hands multiple times in a day, wash and sanitize every object brought from outside, and sanitize all public transport at a certain interval in a day. ",
  "[29] The water consumption, as well as the wastewater generation all across the globe, have now increased manifold. The UN-Habitat is working with partners to facilitate access to running water and hand washing in informal settlements. [28] With the increased exploitation of water  resources in 2020 its reported that by 2030 700 million people might be displaced by water scarcity. [30]\nClimate Change Threat\nClimate change is a major challenge in the attainment of the sustainable development goal 6 on clean water and sanitation for all. Pollution through fossil fuels have resulted to contamination of water undermining access to clean water and causing climate change that is altering the weather patterns increasing drought in some areas and floods in other areas. Renzaho et al. ",
  "(2017) proposes need for the biofuels to reduce effects of climate change on access to clean water and sanitation. Ho & Goethals (2019) the SDG 6 is threatened by the emerging global threats including climate change, biological invasions, water depletion, and land use intensification which is endangering the sustainable future reservoirs and lakes. ",
  "It is such threat on future reservoirs and lakes that demonstrates how SDG 6 among other SDGs are threatened by climate change. Urbanization, watercourse resistance, microplastics, and other forms of pollution are increasing devastations of climate change while undermining the sustainability of the reservoirs and lakes. Mycoo (2018) recommends need to address the water governance challenges to facilitate in meeting SDG 6. Thus, there is need for more policies, tools, and good practices to address the increasing issue of water security and also attaining sustainable developments under the threats of climate change. Similarly, Delany-Crowe et al. (2019) policies centered on the attaining SDG 6 and 13 plus 14 requires integrating of climate change strategies where comprehensive mitigation approaches are enacted. ",
  "Holcomb (2021) illustrates the essence of more emphasis on threat climate change poses on SDG 6 and environmental measurement approaches. Supply and Demand-Sided Challenges\nClean water and sanitation are not only affected by macro-environmental trends, but they are also affected by large-scale industrial targets and water consumption habits. ",
  "[31] As developing nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-South-East Asia become more affluent, these countries have unique challenges to recycle and protect water ecosystems. At the establishment of Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the previous MDGs had left 663 million needing improved water access. [32]\nIn 2019, GLAAS [UN-Water Global Analysis And Assessment Of Sanitation And Drinking-Water] found that only 6 of 101 countries were fully equipped with financial and human resources to tackle cleaning and sanitizing water supplies within their own countries. [33]  Consistently. Less than 15% of countries are adequately meeting the goal of properly funding clean water and sanitation efforts within their own countries [ibid]. This funding shortfall affects other areas relating to SDG 6 and its progress indicators. ",
  "For example, while clean drinking water efforts have been funded relatively well, sanitation, waste-water management, and hygiene areas have stalled in their progress towards 2030. [34]\nMuch of the focus on the next decade is on Sub-Saharan African countries that will likely not meet their targets if growing funding is not secure within the next decade. ",
  "Libey et.al, (2020) note that even in 2 chosen destinations in North-Eastern Africa where utilities taxes are higher than their surrounding regions, public utilities are not able to keep up with regular demand of water. [35] \nIn further complicating the issue, multi-level governance remains an important factor to efficiently directing funds to where they are needed. Nkiaka et.al, (2021), wrote that sustainable water management practices were only possible if there is a local solution for Sub-Saharan Africa that integrates existing water management techniques and practices. [36]\n\nMonitoring and Progress[edit]\nHigh-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General. The most recent one is from April 2020. [5] The report before that was from May 2019. ",
  "[25]\nAdditionally, updates and progress can also be found on the SDG website that is managed by the United Nations. [4]\nMonitoring Progress from Global Status\nMonitoring national-level progress of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 through internationally agreed indicators has been the focus of intense scrutiny and considerable resourcing by international organisations and national governments. ",
  "SDG 6 comprises six core targets and nine core indicators, as well as two means of implementation (MoI) targets and indicators. Indicators for SDG 6 will be monitored and reported on at an international level by United Nations (UN) custodian agencies under the UN-Water managed Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 (IMI), although national data and results will form the basis of all monitoring and reporting. [37]\nIn many cases, surrogate indicators will have to be used to measure progress (or the lack of it). Thus, implementation of the SDGs implies continuous monitoring and periodic evaluation to check whether the direction and pace of development are right. [38]\nThere are 11 global indicators to track progress towards SDG 6. The global estimates are based on country data, compiled and verified by the United Nations agencies responsible, sometimes complemented by data from other sources. ",
  "[39]\n\nIndicator 6.1.1 \u2013 Drinking water\u00a0: 74% of the world's population use a safely managed drinking water service (SDG indicator 6.1.1, 2007-2020)\nIndicator 6.2.1a \u2013 Sanitation\u00a0:  54% of the world's population use a safely managed sanitation service (SDG indicator 6.2.1a, 2016-2020)\nIndicator 6.2.1b \u2013 Hygiene\u00a0:  71% of the world's population have access to a basic handwashing facility (SDG indicator 6.2.1b, 2014-2020)\nIndicator 6.3.1 \u2013 Wastewater treatment\u00a0:  56% of the world's household wastewater is safely treated (SDG indicator 6.3.1, 2020)\nIndicator 6.3.2 \u2013 Water quality\u00a0: 72% of the world's monitored water bodies has good ambient water quality (SDG indicator 6.3.2, 2017-2020)\nIndicator 6.4.1 \u2013 Water use efficiency\u00a0:  19 $/m3 is the ratio of dollar value added to the volume of water used at the global level (SDG indicator 6.4.1, 2017-2018)\nIndicator 6.4.2 \u2013 Water stress\u00a0: 17% of the world's renewable water resources is being withdrawn, after taking into account environmental flow requirements (SDG indicator 6.4.2, 2018)\nindicator 6.5.1 \u2013 Integrated water resources management\u00a0:  54% is the degree of implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) at the global level (SDG indicator 6.5.1, 2017-2020)\nIndicator 6.5.2 \u2013 Transboundary water cooperation\u00a0: 58% of transboundary basin area has an operational arrangement for water cooperation (SDG indicator 6.5.2, 2020)\nIndicator 6.6.1 \u2013 Water-related ecosystems\u00a0: At the global level, not enough country data were reported in 2016 to estimate the change in the extent of water-related ecosystems (SDG indicator 6.6.1)\nindicator 6.a.1 \u2013 International cooperation\u00a0: 9.3 b$ is the global amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance received in 2019 (SDG indicator 6.a.1)\nindicator 6.b.1 \u2013 Community participation\u00a0: Community participation is measured through multiple indicators which are not aggregated into one overall value (SDG 6 indicator 6.b.1)\nIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (2015, p.\u00a07) wrote that robust indicators will do two things: enable the SDG targets to act as a management tool to help countries and the global community create evidence-based implementation strategies and allocate resources accordingly; and act as a report card to measure SDG progress. [37]\nComparing these SDG 6 indicators at the national level allows us to better assess the progress of different countries in terms of SDG. ",
  "For example: In Canada, 99% of the population use a safely managed drinking water service(SDG indicator 6.1.1, 2020); 84% of the population use a safely managed sanitation service (SDG indicator 6.2.1a, 2020);\n82% of the household wastewater in Canada are safely treated  (SDG indicator 6.3.1, 2020), etc. [40] By comparing these indicators above, this shows that Canada has made great results in achieving SDG 6. Water Footprint\nWater footprints shows the extent of water use in relation to consumption by people. [41]\nThe water footprint (WF) is a multi-dimensional indicator, measuring both water consumption (the consumptive WF) and water pollution (the degradative WF). The consumptive WF splits into a green WF, measuring consumption of rainwater, and a blue WF, measuring consumption of groundwater or surface water. [42] How water footprints can help monitor progress on SDG 6.3 and 6.4? ",
  "The grey Water Footprint can be a relevant indicator for measuring progress on target 6.3. The grey Water Footprint can be expressed in terms of a polluted water volume per unit of a specific process or product. ",
  "The blue Water Footprint can be a relevant indicator for measuring progress on target 6.4. The blue Water Footprint can be expressed in terms of a water volume consumed per unit of a specific process or product. Progress of Water Action Decade\n2005-2015:  Water for Life\nThe primary goal of 'Water for Life' is to promote efforts to fulfill international commitments made on water and water related issues. These commitments include the Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015 and to stop unsustainable exploitation of water resources. At the World Summit in Johannesburg in 2002, two other goals were adopted: to aim to develop integrated water resource management and water efficiency plans by 2005 and to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation. World Water Day, 22 March 2005, marked the official commencement of the 'Water for Life' Decade. ",
  "2018-2028: Averting a global water crisis\n40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030 coupled with a burgeoning world population according to current estimates has the world careening towards a global water crisis. Recognizing the growing challenge, the UN General Assembly launched the Water Action Decade officially the International Decade for Action\u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201don 22 March 2018, to mobilize action that will help transform how we manage water. ",
  "[43] The new Decade will focus on the sustainable development and integrated management of water resources for the achievement of social, economic and environmental objectives and on the implementation and promotion of related programmes and projects, as well as on the furtherance of cooperation and partnership at all levels in order to help to achieve internationally agreed water-related goals and targets, including those contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. [43]\n\nLinks with other SDGs[edit]\n Sustainable Development Goals\nThe SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs. [44] WASH experts have stated that without progress on Goal 6, the other goals and targets cannot be achieved. [45][46]\nFor example, sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (SDG 8) which would also lead to economic growth. [47]  SDG 6 progress improves health (SDG 3) and social justice (SDG 16). ",
  "[48] Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving SDG 12 (sustainable consumption and production) and SDG 2 (end hunger). Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 1 (no poverty). ",
  "[47]\nSanitation systems with a resource recovery and reuse focus are getting increased attention. [49] They can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context. [47]\n\nOrganizations[edit]\nThe Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) has made it its mission to help achieve Targets 6.2 and 6.3. [50][51] Global organizations such as Oxfam, UNICEF, WaterAid and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centers, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG 6. [52]\n\nUS Based Organizations[edit][edit]\nIn the US there are over three thousand tax-exempt organizations working on issues related to UN SDG 6, according to data filed with the Internal Revenue Service \u2013IRS and aggregated by X4Impact. ",
  "[53] X4Impact, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation,[54] Hewlett Foundation,[55] and Giving Tech Labs, created a free online interactive tool Clean Water and Sanitation in the US. This online tool enables users to see water and sanitation related indicators nationally and by state, as well as relevant information for over three thousand tax-exempt organizations in the US working on issues related to UN SDG 6. ",
