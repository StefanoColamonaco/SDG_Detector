  "Technology is the means, engineers, mathematicians and scientists have the solution. This is your call.Last update May 17, 2021 by Leo Sorge Current approaches to water, food, and production need to be reverse-engineered worldwide to achieve real sustainability for the global population. ICT technology provides the foundation on which to build disruptive solutions that will change the world forever. This change can be called a digital transformation: teams can build ingenious, disruptive solutions based on an ICT foundation. These solutions will be available to the whole world, thanks to a Cloud-based deployment. Artificial Intelligence will handle the more challenging, data-hungry feeds, allowing decision makers and private citizens to make the best possible decisions around sustainability issues.",
  "The systems that produce food and water, and the industry that sustains ten billion people all need to undergo a worldwide process of re-engineering. People and organizations need to organize themselves in a new, interlinked way to allow the human race to live long and prosper!",
  "Fortunately, technology may prove to be an important part of the cure for what ails us. Even better, you can be part of that cure. Join the IBM Call for Code Global Challenge 2021 NOW!

The 2021 edition presents your creative mind with three different challenges \u2013 all you have to do is choose the best fit for you.",
  "The challenges focus on: zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, and responsible production/green consumption. IBM has been sponsored this initiative for a long time and continues to do so.",
  "What are you waiting for? Be part of the fun, pick the challenge that is right for you, and build your skills whilst also creating meaningful change! The most direct way to get involved with Call for Code is by forming a team and competing in the Global Challenge. If your current schedule does not allow you to be part of a team, you can help by contributing code to existing open-source projects instead. The Pillars Competing in a global challenge offers every participant a huge bonus \u2013 the chance to understand how each step of a large project is realised. This deepens many individual competencies and broadens participants\u2019 overall perspective.",
  "Anyone can create a winning solution! Open-Source, community-driven environments provide a strong foundations for digital projects today.",
  "Every international project draws on a solid network of communities and components to maximum advantage. Based on such strong foundations, robust environments can easily be developed with the help of a rich infrastructure, such as that of IBM. Every competitor\u2019s goal is to win, and this is equally true of the Call For Code Global Challenge 2021. Broader horizons are an important take-away for every participant. Then of course, there\u2019s the chance that participation might launch a developer to international prominence and worldwide visibility, whether by winning or simply participating. A path to Responsible Computing Responsibility \u2013 it\u2019s a hugely important point.",
  "This year, Call for Code is tackling the imminent and existential threat to Planet Earth: climate change. As the United Nations says, \u201cThe impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale.",
  "Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.\u201d Rashik Parnar, a technologist working in IBM for about 40 years, has been involved with the Call for Code Global Challenge several years as both a judge and a mentor. Rashik and his fellow technologists view using tech for good, as well as responsible computing, as the path forward to a better future for our world. Rashik supports Call for Code teams with his expertise, helping them unleash their potential impact, and has this to say: \u201cWhether you want to build new skills to carry forward into your professional career, meet a worldwide community of innovators, or inscribe your code on a transformative solution that effectively combats climate change, the time to answer the call is now! Join Call for Code and be part of the solution. \u201c LikeBee, optimizing plastic use Plastic is a big part of production processes all over the world. Every macro-region is pursuing ways to lower the impact of all kinds of plastics on the environment.",
  "Finding a way to lower the impact of plastic is very important \u2013 this family of materials makes a large contribution to climate change. By 2050, the carbon footprint of plastic is expected to account for a full fifteen percent of the global annual carbon budget.",
  "One of the Regional Winners of the 2020 Call for Code Challenge, LikeBee from Brazil, has good news for us: recycling can save energy and reduce plastic-related carbon emissions. This team created LikeBee to help consumers become more conscious of the positive impact they can have on reducing plastics. The team developed an intelligent recycling bin, associated with its own app: this complete solution records a user\u2019s recycling activity and offers digital discount coupons, based on the level of activity achieved, that can be used at stores in the LikeBee network. Delving deep into the Production Challenge The current use of natural resources is unsustainable. The global material footprint rose nearly eighteen percent \u2013 from 73 billion metric tons in 2010 to 85.9 billion metric tons \u2013 in 2017. These numbers come from a UN report that also establishes seventeen essential goals to be achieved in relation to climate change.",
  "In particular, Goal Twelve aims to achieve economic growth and sustainable development, while reducing our ecological footprint by changing the way we produce and consume goods and resources. Technology can help responsible production and green consumption in many ways, from recommendations on energy efficiency to highlighting the carbon footprint of online purchases.",
  "The goal of the Production Challenge is to take into account all phases of resource use, so that we can do more and better with less. This challenge might involve integrating many pieces of technology to create a single solution. Tech #1: Container management through Kubernetes orchestrationTech #2: Fastify responsiveness for happy users and serversTech #3: IBM Watson Discovery to scan market dataTech #4: IBM Cloudant-based approach to data storage. The proposed architecture The user interacts with a web application for the marketplace.The React app communicates with the back-end APIs.The Fastify back end handles data requested by the web app and exposes some public endpoints for material market data through a RESTful API.The back end queries Watson Discovery for updated information on materials.Discovery manages a collection of recycled and non-recycled material information, such as average prices, carbon impact, and quality. Discovery enriches the data with natural language processing so that it can be more easily indexed.Discovery crawls public websites for updates on current material information.The back end stores and retrieves information on material that is provided by users in an IBM Cloudant NoSQL database.A Kubernetes cluster is used for a scalable, flexible, modern containerized environment.New Relic provides Full-Stack Observability and monitoring within the Kubernetes environment. The idea One of the more pressing challenges in addressing waste and shifting to a more circular economy is the increasing complexity of products.",
  "Electronics are getting smaller and more sophisticated, making recovery and reuse of materials challenging. Product designers should create products with end-of-life in mind, by reducing the number of components, for example.",
  "Communities could benefit from developing infrastructure, policies, and systems to support repair, reuse, and recycling. To encourage this change, IBM proposes creating a transparent and trustworthy platform for trading resources and knowledge, that also provides access to a community of experts. This platform will enable producers and consumers to build and buy products in a sustainable way by reducing waste, increasing the use of recycled materials, and improving the overall repairability of products. The platform would support both the producer/manufacturer and the material supplier. A producer or manufacturer can find and compare the price, quality, and carbon impact of recycled materials while learning about best practices for recyclable processing, through a trustworthy, real-time trading platform. A recycled material supplier can sell recycled resources directly to producers through a marketplace at competitive rates.",
  "More ideas on the Production challenge There\u2019s no limit to the projects you and your team may submit. IBM has sketched out some more ideas and listed them on a dedicated GitHub page.",
