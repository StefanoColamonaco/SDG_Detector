November 16, 2021 by Angie Lee Share Email A partial differential equation is \u201cthe most powerful tool humanity has ever created,\u201d Cornell University mathematician Steven Strogatz wrote in a 2009 New York Times opinion piece.",
  "This quote opened last week\u2019s GTC talk AI4Science: The Convergence of AI and Scientific Computing, presented by Anima Anandkumar, director of machine learning research at NVIDIA and professor of computing at the California Institute of Technology. Anandkumar explained that partial differential equations are the foundation for most scientific simulations. And she showcased how this historic tool is now being made all the more powerful with AI. \u201cThe convergence of AI and scientific computing is a revolution in the making,\u201d she said. Using new neural operator-based frameworks to learn and solve partial differential equations, AI can help us model weather forecasting 100,000x quicker \u2014 and carbon dioxide sequestration 60,000x quicker \u2014 than traditional models. Speeding Up the Calculations Anandkumar and her team developed the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), a framework that allows AI to learn and solve an entire family of partial differential equations, rather than a single instance.",
  "It\u2019s the first machine learning method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution \u2014 which means that FNOs enable AI to make high-resolution inferences without high-resolution training data, which would be necessary for standard neural networks. FNO-based machine learning greatly reduces the costs of obtaining information for AI models, improves their accuracy and speeds up inference by three orders of magnitude compared with traditional methods.",
  "Mitigating Climate Change FNOs can be applied to make real-world impact in countless ways. For one, they offer a 100,000x speedup over numerical methods and unprecedented fine-scale resolution for weather prediction models. By accurately simulating and predicting extreme weather events, the AI models can allow planning to mitigate the effects of such disasters. The FNO model, for example, was able to accurately predict the trajectory and magnitude of Hurricane Matthew from 2016. In the video below, the red line represents the observed track of the hurricane. The white cones show the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s hurricane forecasts based on traditional models.",
  "The purple contours mark the FNO-based AI forecasts. As shown, the FNO model follows the trajectory of the hurricane with improved accuracy compared with the traditional method \u2014 and the high-resolution simulation of this weather event took just a quarter of a second to process on NVIDIA GPUs.",
  "In addition, Anandkumar\u2019s talk covered how FNO-based AI can be used to model carbon dioxide sequestration \u2014 capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, which scientists have said can help mitigate climate change. Researchers can model and study how carbon dioxide would interact with materials underground using FNOs 60,000x faster than with traditional methods. Anandkumar said the FNO model is also a significant step toward building a digital twin of Earth. The new NVIDIA Modulus framework for training physics-informed machine learning models and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform equip researchers and developers with the tools to combine the powers of AI, physics and supercomputing \u2014 to help solve the world\u2019s toughest problems. \u201cI strongly believe this is the future of science,\u201d Anandkumar said. She\u2019ll delve into these topics further at a SC21 plenary talk, taking place on Nov. 18 at 10:30 a.m. Central time.",
