"For watering plants, use waste water that comes off washing of food items. Use water efficient sprinkler and drip irrigation for your garden. Promote drip irrigation and other water conservation methods in agriculture. Practice rainwater harvesting. RWAs should adopt this in every public park of their locality. Make sure you have a faucet aerator on each faucet. These inexpensive appliances conserve water, keeping water pressure high. Make roof top rain water harvesting and recharging wells/ tanks mandatory. Utilize kitchen waste water for home gardening. Take advantage of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (PMKSY), Integrated Water Management Programme (IWMP) and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for the conservation of water and agriculture development. Establish community nursery by using waste water and distribute saplings in the neighbourhood. Wash utensils using collected water in a bucket instead of washing directly under the running tap. Instead of washing mop the floor select village level volunteers to check whether all the public taps and pipes are leak free. Promote Eco-san toilets : a closed water - less system. Skip rinsing dishes before using your dishwasher and save water in each load."
