Elon Musk speaks at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing \"Cyber Rodeo\" grand opening party. Photo by Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images Amber X. Chen April 8, 2022 Tesla\u2019s latest Gigafactory opened on Thursday in eastern Travis County. The company hosted a launch party dubbed a \u201cCyber Rodeo.\u201d The invite-only confab saw the factory turned into a rave, complete with a light-up drone display of Tesla vehicles and the visage of doge in the night sky, food trucks and a speech from Elon Musk himself. The richest man in the world told attendees the plant is \u201cgoing to be better for the environment, because we want to make the cars where the customers are.\u201dBut while the plant promises a shiny and sustainable all-electric future as it pumps out Tesla Model Ys and, eventually, Semis and Cybertrucks, the communities in its shadow are still living in the past.",
  "And the Gigafactory could end up leaving them even further behind.Eastern Travis County is an unincorporated area of East Austin composed of low-income households, and predominantly communities of color. Austin\u2019s Colony, the specific community where the new Gigafactory is located, has a large Spanish-speaking population, while other nearby communities share similar demographics and are historically Black.",
  "Even before the Gigafactory came to town, the area faced challenges, including a lack of access to clean water and poor social services. It\u2019s a place that has essentially been cut off from the city itself, with Austin\u2019s 1928 master plan forcing residents of color out to the east of what is now I-35. That dividing line also meant industries unwanted in the heart of Austin could flourish on its outskirts. Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory could be the latest in the long list of polluters to call the area home.Gigafactory construction has raised issues from noise and water pollution to clogged roadways. Austin\u2019s Colony residents also see hypocrisy in the plant getting clean public water while theirs is private and dirty. There are also concerns that the Gigafactory\u2019s location along the Colorado River could create an environmental catastrophe should the river overflow its banks.",
  "The tensions reflect ones playing out around the world as companies building the all-electric future, like Tesla, set up shop in low-income communities of color.

  "\u201cWhen we heard that Tesla was considering moving into the area, there was a great deal of trepidation with what they would or would not provide,\u201d Austin\u2019s Colony resident and community activist Richard Franklin told Protocol. \u201cOur thought process was: We know that they\u2019ve had some issues; we know that they may be bad actors. But we have so many other issues [from before] they got here that it\u2019s almost to the point of saying, \u2018Well, what else could go wrong?\u2019 Our hope is that by bringing something as huge as Tesla into this area, we would increase its profile so that people would start paying attention to all the shortcomings.\u201dThe Gigafactory is located right behind Franklin\u2019s house on the site of former aggregate mining operations, which have a long history in the area owing to copious sand and gravel deposits. Tesla\u2019s entry into the community has increased property values in the area roughly 22% from 2020 to 2021, according to an analysis by real estate service firm Orchard.But increased land values often lead to gentrification, forcing many longtime residents to leave an area. With home values in Austin skyrocketing, Austin\u2019s Colony residents could someday have no other affordable place to turn. But even as the Gigafactory raises the risk of residents being displaced long term, it poses potential immediate environmental risks.",
  "PODER, Austin\u2019s local environmental justice organization, has cited concerns about the Gigafactory\u2019s proximity to the Colorado River, among other issues. \u201cThe Colorado River Conservancy goes from the Longhorn Dam to the Travis County line, and Tesla is right adjacent to it,\u201d PODER director Susana Almanza told Protocol.",
  "\u201cEarly on, when Tesla said that they were developing a Colorado River \u2018paradise,\u2019 we knew that they needed to be sitting at the table with us so we could know exactly what their Colorado River paradise really means for East Austin.\u201d Elon Musk\u2019s so-called \u201cecological paradise\u201d has so far failed to materialize. In fact, it\u2019s been the opposite. Many residents have complained to PODER of increased traffic and noise coming from the factory, as well as a higher risk of flooding. The organization is also deeply concerned with Tesla\u2019s water use. Reports of orange water pouring out of sinks in communities around the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin. Photo courtesy of Brian Reyes \u201cTesla consumes a lot of water, but we are not sure exactly how much water they\u2019re going to be consuming and how much they are going to be discharging,\u201d Almanza said.Austin\u2019s Colony is one of two communities in the area that rely on privatized water.",
  "The quality of that water is a huge concern, with residents reporting orange water pouring from their taps. Franklin said he has to filter it before giving it to his dog, and that it ruins pipes and appliances.",
  "But it is his hope that as more people see the contrast between Tesla\u2019s water situation and the community\u2019s, the more pressure it will put on the city to extend its water infrastructure into the community. PODER, too, is considering how to leverage Tesla\u2019s clean water deal for the community.\u201cWe are doing more investigation into how we can get these working-class communities on the city water system like they did Tesla, so they can pay lower bills as opposed to buying from private water sources,\u201d Almanza said.\u201cTesla, to me, is just another pawn in the game, another piece on the board in a chess game that involves me, my community and the kids,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another piece to be moved around, and we\u2019ve learned to use whatever we can to get what we need.\u201dBut that could come with trade-offs. Franklin\u2019s biggest fear is flooding: The massive Gigafactory spreads over 2,000 acres of cleared swampland. The concrete that has replaced formerly permeable surfaces has effectively removed flood buffers in an area that is next to the Colorado River. And with climate change increasing the odds of heavy rain, that makes the risks of runoff and flooding more serious than ever before.",
  "Just this past August, rainfall blitzed the region and left the state Capitol closed after flood waters filled hallways. Federal data shows Texas is part of a region that saw heavy downpours increase 12% from 1958 to 2016.",
  "Meanwhile, the state received a C- on the American Society of Civil Engineers infrastructure report card when it comes to its ability to handle flooding. It\u2019s against this backdrop that the Gigafactory could create serious issues for those living in its hulking shadow and seemingly endless parking lots.\u201cWe\u2019re down river. This is my real fear \u2026 I\u2019m afraid the people that live in those low-lying areas right down the river from here are going to die,\u201d Franklin said. Tesla has not yet said anything publicly about its stormwater management policy.Other community members are more skeptical of this perceived corporate interest to enhanced social services pipeline.\u201cThe area has been described [by Elon Musk] in very colonial terms as this place that is essentially destroyed, that there\u2019s not really people there, it\u2019s just this land to be discovered and modernized and made valuable,\u201d East Austin native Ryan Frisinger told Protocol. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s extremely populated.\u201d Frisinger lives three and a half miles from the Gigafactory. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a history of that out there,\u201d he said, referring to the legacy of polluting industries in the region.",
  "\u201cNow that Tesla\u2019s out there, a lot of that is being revealed sort of accidentally because most of the real estate in that area has now acquired value.\u201dHe called Tesla \u201cperhaps the scariest and largest\u201d major company to move into the area and set up an industrial shop. \u201cI worry that the area will become just like Boca Chica,\u201d he said, referring to the site of SpaceX\u2019s Starbase, \u201cwhere you buy people out and then all you have to say is: We offer them more than market value for their home.",
  "There are already signs of that happening.\u201d Homes in Boca Chica Village near SpaceX facilities in Texas. Photo: Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for Protocol The city gave Tesla a $50 million tax incentive to entice the company to put down its Gigafactory roots there instead of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was also in the running. It\u2019s a move that\u2019s all too familiar as cities around the country try to woo tech companies in exchange for promised economic prosperity.\u201cAbsolutely [the city is complicit in this]. I think that everyone\u2019s mesmerized, and that\u2019s usually how corporations work,\u201d Almanza said. \u201cThey all come in dangling a carrot of \u2018jobs, jobs, jobs.\u2019 But in essence, we found that the local people don\u2019t really get the jobs, and the jobs they\u2019re talking about are temporary jobs \u2014 construction, cleanup \u2014 versus the higher-paying jobs and permanent jobs.\u201dTesla has also faced criticism from the Texas Anti-Poverty Project for refusing to make the accommodations necessary to hire Spanish speakers in a community that is primarily Latinx. This concern follows a pattern of racial hostility.",
  "This past February, Tesla was sued by California Department for Fair Employment and Housing over allegations of creating a hostile work environment for Black employees.Tesla did not respond to Protocol\u2019s request for comment. The company does not have a PR team, and PODER organizers have already expressed issues with Tesla\u2019s community outreach efforts.\u201cWe just recently had a talk with the community engagement person, and I asked, \u2018Well, how are you bringing in these 15,000 people [for the opening party]?\u2019\u201d Almanza said.",
  "\u201cHe said \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really know, that\u2019s not my area.\u2019 I think as a community engagement person, you should know this.\u201d The Oak Ranch mobile home gated community in Del Valle, Texas. At Oak Ranch, the sales force is regularly fielding inquiries from potential buyers hoping to land a gig at the Tesla Gigafactory. Photo: Sergio Flores/Bloomberg via Getty Images Now that Tesla is in the community, Almanza said that it has a duty to be a good neighbor \u2014 like by using its clout to push for the community\u2019s water rights \u2014 and it needs to sustain its relationship with the people living in close proximity. \u201cTesla needs to be doing real community engagement, not having one big party and pretending that that\u2019s community engagement,\u201d she said.What\u2019s happening in eastern Travis County right now is a microcosm of a bigger story playing out around the world as we make the necessary transition to clean energy. The fight to build a better future hinges on drawing down carbon emissions. Yes, Tesla is doing good by bringing that future into existence as the most popular EV manufacturer in the U.S. \u2014 but at what cost to local residents?",
  "Tensions regarding how we achieve a sustainable future aren\u2019t just happening in East Austin: They\u2019re happening in lithium flats in Bolivia, cobalt mines in Congo, coal towns in Wyoming and elsewhere. \u201cWe\u2019re accepting some degree of necessary evil in exchange for jobs, improved infrastructure, visibility, community investment, etc., and the overall issue with that is: Where are the examples of this?\u201d Frisinger said.",
  "\u201cTesla has received public subsidies throughout the world and has rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 delivered on the performance incentives that are required. They have never tangibly provided evidence for what they\u2019re going to do [for our community] in exchange for all the benefits they\u2019re receiving and the pollution that they\u2019re going to introduce.\u201dAmber X.
