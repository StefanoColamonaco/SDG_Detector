Over the next three years, Nike will work with China\u2019s Ministry of Education to transform the culture of sport and physical activity in schools across China. ",
  "The company will train up to 7,000 teachers in how to deliver quality and engaging sports lessons, provide best-in-class coaching and physical education (PE) resources for more than 300 schools and work with basketball and soccer school leagues. \u201cToday\u2019s generation of children is the least physically active in history and we can help change that,\u201d explains Parker. \u201cNike has always believed in the power of sport to unleash human potential. We know that active kids are happier, healthier and more successful. That\u2019s why we\u2019re partnering with China\u2019s Ministry of Education to create more opportunities for China\u2019s kids to move before, during and after school.\u201d\nThe commitment builds upon a three-year partnership between Nike and the Ministry of Education, which has catalyzed change in China\u2019s schools. By creating the country\u2019s first soccer-specific physical education curriculum for primary schools and training more than 3,400 PE teachers across China, Nike has already helped impact the lives of more than 800,000 kids. ",
  "This new expansion underscores Nike\u2019s ongoing global commitment to getting kids active and reversing physical inactivity trends. Read more about Nike\u2019s Global Community Impact\u00a0and how Nike supports important causes that strengthen communities across the globe\u00a0here. "
