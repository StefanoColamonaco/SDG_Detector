Fashion May 17th, 2018 Author Filippo Vego Nike saves the Earth with sustainable bubbles \u201cA large part of achieving those goals rests on how Nike makes its Air bags\u201d Share Tweet Pin 124 Recently Nike published its Sustainable Business Report and the objectives are only for real game changers of the industry, as Nike is. This report shows Nike\u2019s emblematic 30-year commitment to sustainability and the outstanding information is: 75 percent of all Nike shoes and apparel now contain some recycled material, and Nike is the industry leader of using recycled polyester. Yarn, soles and basketball courts are a few examples of the many products Nike creates by transforming plastic bottles, manufacturing scraps and used product into new materials, do you want to know what they become? The Air unit.",
  "Probably Nike\u2019s most iconic product manufactured in a sustainable way. As the brand declares: \"Air is one of Nike\u2019s most sustainable innovations\".",
  "Introduced in 1979 the Air unit consists of pressurized air inside a plastic flexible bag, that generally sits in the midsole beneath the heel, forefoot or both to provide the sensation of walking or running on air. Nike through the years worked really hard on this technology to improve it in different aspects. In the last decades Nike realized always bigger, stronger and lighter Air Units, but now in 2018, it's not enough. Companies in 2018 need to figure out their impact on people\u2019s lives, but also on our planet\u2019s life, setting concrete objectives to reduce the impact on the earth by using more recycled materials and sustainable energies. Nike has already set its objectives, as the improvement of the percentage of recycled materials in its production to reach 100-percent of the manufacturing use of renewable energy across North America by 2019 (halfway toward reaching its worldwide goal by 2025). \u201cA large part of achieving those goals rests on how Nike makes its Air bags\u201d says Nike and the brand's illustrators show 11 simple drafts on how they make their Airbags.",
