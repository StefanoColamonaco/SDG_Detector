Those who knew Greg Land as a child probably wouldn\u2019t have predicted that the bookish, brainy Texan would one day become an international businessman and world traveler.",
  "Land grew up one of eight siblings. His strict and religious family spent vacations driving across the American South. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to do big vacations,\u201d Land told Industrious. \u201cFor us, a vacation was renting an RV and visiting our relatives. I didn\u2019t go to Disneyland as a child.\u201d Though he never experienced Disney\u2019s It\u2019s a Small World ride, his career has led him to a life of global exposure. Today, as IBM\u2019s Global Industry Leader for Aviation, Hospitality and Travel Related Services, Land loves making deals across continents.",
  "\u201cAt one point my siblings thought I was a CIA operative,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I\u2019d go to a place like Johannesburg or Dubai on 24-hour notice.\u201dWant to enhance the journey for your globetrotting customers? Land\u2019s life changed the day he quit being an accountant in 1989 (\u201cI was bored out of my mind\u201d) and went to work for an airline.",
  "Until then, he led what he calls as a \u201cvery sheltered life.\u201d He made friends with other airline employees, and together they would play a game called Gate Roulette. Every Friday night, they drove to the airport and picked a gate number at random. Then, they took a standby seat on wherever the plane was headed. He wound end up in Des Moines one Saturday and in London another. \u201cI see my travel as being much more of an education than books ever were,\u201d Greg said with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning through meeting new people and observing other cultures.\u201d Land, who speaks with genuine enthusiasm, wants everyone to cultivate the same wanderlust that drives him.",
  "\u201cIn 2008, I took my family to Italy for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rented a villa on an olive farm.",
  "For two of my nephews and niece, it was their first time getting a passport. It totally changed their minds about what\u2019s outside of the United States.\u201d Greg Land traverses the Inca Trail on one of his many adventures (Photo: Greg Land) Could his family have done the trip without his experienced hand as a guide? \u201cNo way,\u201d he said. It\u2019s clear that being a guide is both a calling and inspiration for Land. Navigating itineraries can be difficult, especially for novice travelers like his family. To that end, Land feels professionally driven to improve the various stages of a customer\u2019s journey, to make it simpler.",
  "For instance, Land and his colleagues worked with United Airlines to equip flight attendants with IBM MobileFirst iOS Passenger+. The app centers around empowering flight attendants to noticeably improve the travel experience for passengers.",
  "\u201cIf you\u2019re on an airplane and your connecting flight gets cancelled,\u201d Land said, \u201cthey can come to your seat and rebook you from the air. That really does ease your arrival into a new city.\u201d This type of customer-first optimization has regularly been appreciated off the tarmac, as well \u2014 IBM\u2019s Travel & Transportation team was recently named Best AI Travel Technology by The World Travel Awards. Greg Land climbs above 14,000 feet on the Inca Trail. (Photo: Greg Land) \u201cWe\u2019ve been so vocal about how AI can really drive personalization of the travel experience,\u201d Land said. \u201cThe secret to personalizing it is in the cognitive capabilities and leveraging everything from the weather data to the unstructured data. It\u2019s all part of the analysis around why somebody is traveling and how a company can make somebody\u2019s trip better.\u201d For jetsetter Land, travel is part of his personal and professional lives.",
  "The fact that he\u2019s made a stellar career out of something he loves continues to fuel his desire to keep seeing more of the world. His next trip is in late December to South Africa, where he\u2019ll celebrate the new year on safari."
