It\u2019s a good match for your skills and an even better match for your ambitions \u2014 the kind of opportunity that gets you excited about the possibilities of a career at Microsoft.",
  "But let\u2019s face it: Landing the job you want is rarely an easy or relaxing process. Everything from spiffing up your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to wowing your interviewers can be challenging and completely nerve-racking. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve asked several Microsoft recruiters how you can boost your chances of getting the job. \u201cWere you a chess master or a championship-winning tennis player?\u201d \u201cI look for people who like to work hard, have fun and do it with a positive attitude. I think those are important attributes to success,\u201d says Kameron Swinton, a Microsoft talent sourcer. \u201cI\u2019m also looking for people who have been high achievers, and that\u2019s not limited to their profession.",
  "\u201cWere you a chess master or a championship-winning tennis player?\u201d he asks. \u201cTell me about it.",
  "Not only does it make for a great story but it speaks to your dedication, hard work and perseverance.\u201d \"A sense of partnership and willingness to play nicely with others is golden.\" Recruiter Amy Ala keeps an eye out for certain traits beyond the technical skills of the job, such as the abilities to adapt and collaborate. \u201cA sense of partnership and willingness to play nicely with others is golden,\u201d she says. But for starters, you need to get a foot in the door. A generic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 isn\u2019t likely going to do it, no matter how polished it looks. So make sure it lines up with the job description, because \u201cany communication to the recruiter or hiring managers should be very clear in how you\u2019re a fit for the role,\u201d Ala says.",
  "And you\u2019ve heard it before, because it\u2019s true: Networking is key. Reach out to family, friends, colleagues and anyone else you know to find people who work in the Microsoft group or team you\u2019re interested in.",
  "Use LinkedIn or Twitter. Express your interest and learn what you can. Such efforts can \u201cgive you a better understanding of the organization, and that person may even be able to get your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 into the direct hands of the hiring manager or recruiter,\u201d advises recruiter Colleen Corbin. \u201cDemonstrate a passion for Microsoft and our technologies.\u201d Whether it\u2019s through your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, networking or any other initial contacts, \u201cdemonstrate a passion for Microsoft and our technologies,\u201d as well as for your own work, Swinton says. What are your \u201cpassion projects?\u201d If you\u2019ve developed any Windows or Windows phone apps, for example, make sure that\u2019s known. Hopefully you\u2019ll soon hear what you\u2019ve been waiting for: You\u2019ve got an interview.",
  "It\u2019s thrilling or it\u2019s stressful. Probably both.",
  "So our recruiters have offered their 10 best tips for showing what you\u2019ve got: 1. The most obvious advice is not always heeded: Be prepared. Do your homework on Microsoft products, the technologies and the team, Swinton says. If there are technical skills you\u2019ll need, know them. Ala, who often recruits software engineers, emphasizes that \u201cfundamental coding skills are one of the most challenging aspects of the interview.\u201d 2. Research your way to confidence.",
  "Use LinkedIn and other online resources to learn what you can about the interviewers and their backgrounds. Also make sure you know and can articulate how your skills apply to the job requirements and the needs of the team.",
  "3. Speaking of skills, trust in yours. They\u2019ve already gotten you this far. As Swinton says, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing you here for a reason.\u201d 4. Be yourself. Really.",
  "\u201cWe want to hire the real you, so make sure you shine through,\u201d Corbin says. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be nervous and have the jitters, but allow yourself to enjoy the experience, which will be the best way for us to get to know you.\u201d 5.",
  "Along those same lines: Be honest. \u201cKnowledge can be learned, but trust must be earned,\u201d Swinton says. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell us when you don\u2019t know something.\u201d 6. Ask questions. What questions, you ask? Ala suggests some general possibilities: What makes the hiring team stay at Microsoft?",
  "What do they love about their jobs? What excites them about their work?",
  "And if you\u2019re coming from out of town, she says, ask some questions of your recruiter. Their insights can not only help you get to your interview on time but also assess local housing, schools, entertainment and other factors if relocation is a possibility. 7. Don\u2019t overthink it, Swinton says. Relax if you can. 8.",
  "Work with your recruiter; it benefits both of you. Ala advises: \u201cLet us know about any other conversations you\u2019re having, whether with other Microsoft teams or outside companies, so we can keep things moving and meet any deadlines for setting up interviews or extending offers.\u201d 9.",
  "Always follow up with a \u201cthank you\u201d email to your interviewers. Heard this one before? You\u2019d be surprised how few candidates do it, Corbin says, but \u201cit leaves a great impression.\u201d 10. And if it doesn\u2019t work out? Remember, \u201cno\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cnever.\u201d \u201cOftentimes candidates may not be the exact fit for a certain role, but Microsoft is a huge company. Another team might be a better match,\u201d Ala says.",
  "\u201cTalk with your recruiter about other options, or at the very least let us know it\u2019s OK to share your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 internally with colleagues.\u201d The right role could be right around the corner. Ready to work with smart, creative people who are helping every person on the planet achieve more?",
