  "Expected Date of Publication: Aug 2022 SDG 16 stands for the contribution of peace, justice, and the quality of institutions to sustainable development. It brings core political issues into the development agenda.",
  "Therefore, it stipulates an impact of political issues on development and vice versa. Without any doubt, this is one of the major differences and achievements of the Agenda 2030 compared to former development policy endeavors. After having introduced SDG 16 and its interpretations, Transitioning to Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions focuses on a selected number of fields such as human security, corruption, and inclusivity, to illustrate the challenges and opportunities emerging from this particular component of the global development agenda. Furthermore, this volume also looks at the types of actors involved with SDG 16, including the role of business, and the processes they trigger within national administrations and international organizations. Finally, Transitioning to Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions concludes with an outlook on the impact of SDG 16 on international development. Transitioning to Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions is part of MDPI's new Open Access book series Transitioning to Sustainability.",
