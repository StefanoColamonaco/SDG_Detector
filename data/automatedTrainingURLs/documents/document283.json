Following the release of Nike\u2019s FY20 Impact Report, Nike has committed itself to achieve a host of sustainability targets by 2025.",
  "The SDGs outline a positive vision for the future, but require deliberate action to get there. Nike argues that it is in the interests of businesses, governments and society alike to commit to such goals in order to accelerate progress. Nike currently scores 3/5 on our Sustainability Hub. However these crucial new commitments could soon see that rating improve. Not only has the brand set these targets as important benchmarks for itself as a key player in the retail industry. They have also aligned with many of the UN\u2019s SDG\u2019s where the brand feels it could have the greatest impact for good.",
  "So let\u2019s take a look at these goals, and what Nike is doing to be a catalyst for positive change. NIKE\u2019S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Nike has identified the areas where it has the greatest potential to contribute to the SDGs, these include: Good Health and Wellbeing Gender Equality Decent Work and Economic Growth Responsible Consumption and Production Climate Action Partnerships For the Goals Read on to see how Nike plans to drive progress on these six areas of impact.",
  "Good Health and Wellbeing Nike is committed to inspiring and supporting communities around the world to move more. And with good reason, the potential rewards of fostering movement and exercise in children are big: active kids tend to be healthier, happier, and do better on the pitch and in the classroom, and eventually in their careers and communities as adults. As a pioneering sports brand, focussing on a healthy and active lifestyle echoes through the brand culture and employee values. 2025 Target Nike has committed to driving sustained community impact by getting kids excited about moving with 50% female participation in key cities. Gender Equality One of the great elements of sport is its power to unite people and inspire them to take action in their communities. Putting this power into practice, Nike is building an inclusive culture through the brand and breaking down barriers for all athletes.",
  "2025 Target 100% of strategic suppliers increase access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women employed in their facilities 50% representation of women in global corporate workforce and 45% in leadership positions Maintain 100% equal pay equity across all employee levels on an annual basis Drive sustained community impact by empowering kids through sports in key cities with 50% girl participation 2x investment focused on the professional development for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. and women globally Decent Work and Economic Growth As a global company, it isn\u2019t only what goes on within the walls of Nike offices that reflect the extent of its values, but also the conditions of its global partners and suppliers. And as such, Nike believes that the key to growth and sustainability is a team in which every member feels valued.",
  "That means from worker compensation, to workplace conditions, Nike is committed to only working with factories which share its vision for decent work and economic growth. 2025 Target 100% of facilities in the extended supply chain meet the Nike foundational labour, health, safety and environmental standards demonstrating respect for the rights of their workers and communities where they operate 100% of strategic suppliers are building world class, safe and healthy workspaces for the people making Nike products All strategic suppliers are measuring and improving the engagement of the people making said products All strategic suppliers are increasing access to career opportunities and upward mobility for women employed in their facilities Responsible Consumption and Production The iconic Nike swoosh is almost synonymous with great athletic performance. But the brand isn\u2019t only thinking about the athletics we know today, or the next Olympic Games, as part of Nike\u2019s commitment to sustainability ensuring that all athletes can train, live, and thrive for generations to come. This responsibility leads Nike to develop new products and innovative materials in an effort to find ways to help solve production and consumption problems today for a better tomorrow. The focus of this goal is truly maximum performance with minimum impact. And there are many targets in place to ensure this happens.",
  "2025 Target 0.5M tons of GHG emissions reduced through increasing Nike\u2019s use of environmentally preferred materials to 50% of all key materials 10% waste reduction per unit in manufacturing, distribution, headquarters and packaging through improved design and operational efficiency 100% waste diverted from landfill in Nike\u2019s extended supply chain with at least 80% recycled back into Nike products and other goods 10X the amount of finished product waste refurbished, recycled or donated 25% reduction fresh water usage per kg in textile dyeing and finishing Adopt clean chemistry alternatives for the brand\u2019s 10 priority chemistries across its supply chain Climate Action As Nike strives to create products with all the performance and less of the environmental impact, the brand is taking a stand for climate action through its Move to Zero commitment. As the name suggests, this is Nike\u2019s promise toward a zero carbon, zero waste future.",
  "It\u2019s no token effort, Nike says it is committed to taking a leadership role and working collaboratively with other industry players so we can have a world where everyone can thrive. 2025 Target 70% absolute reduction of GHG emissions in owned or operated facilities through 100% renewable electricity and fleet electrification Greenhouse gas emissions from key suppliers\u2019 manufacturing and transportation operations will be at or below 202 levels despite anticipated business growth, through use of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and alternative fuels 0.5M tons of GHG emissions reduced through increasing Nike\u2019s use of environmentally preferred materials to 50% of all key materials To meet Nike\u2019s 2030 Science-Based Target, it needs to reduce its carbon footprint by 65% in owned or operated spaces and by 30% across its extended supply chain Partnerships For the Goals Finally, Nike recognises that the true goals of a sustainable future and a healthier planet will require collaboration, the sports brand has partnered with competitors, governments, academia, NGOs and other industries to develop a shared a holistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities we face as a society. As the saying goes, \u2018if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together\u2019. Altogether this coalition of sorts works to identify barriers and advance solutions for our planet. Example Partnerships Arctic Shipping Pledge: teamed up with the Ocean Conservancy to intentionally not send ships through the Arctic out of concern for the negative environmental impact. Fair Labor Association (FLA): in compliance with FLA\u2019s mission of socially responsible companies to improve working conditions in factories worldwide.",
  "Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC): a founding member of SAC, a group of more than 200 leading apparel and footwear companies and NGOs working to reduce the environmental impacts of their products. Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action: Nike joined UN Climate Change and other global players in catalysing some of the industry\u2019s most aggressive climate targets Girls, Inc.: Nike has teamed up with Girls Inc to support their \u201cSporting Chance\u201d program that empowers girls to build a foundation for enjoying sports, adventure, and physical activity throughout their lives.",
  "THE TAKEAWAY While Nike is one fish (albeit a very big one) in the sea of apparel and footwear production, its commitment to sustainable development is certainly making waves. With the anticipated release of its FY21 Impact Report, customers and communities will have the opportunity to mark the progress against the brand\u2019s goals as it strives for a bright future.
