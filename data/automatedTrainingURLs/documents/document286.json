The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals stands as a major guideline for societies, governments, and businesses to help us focus on specific elements that we should strive to support by whatever means that we are able to through our actions.",
  "In that connection, we would like to offer some insight and perspectives on how we at IBM support the UN Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 both from a global perspective and with a focus on specific cases in the Nordics that we are particularly proud of. In general, IBM has a long history of engaging with the communities where we live and work and we share the UN\u2019s priorities for social advancement. Furthermore, we endorse the strategy of partnership that the SDGs call for because collaboration has long been IBM\u2019s approach to addressing societal challenges. No one can do it alone \u2013 we need to work together across a wide range of stakeholders and areas as many of the issues we stand in front of are interconnected and extremely complex to solve. Our long history of responsible stewardship can be seen every day through our work with environmental programs, supply chain practices, corporate social responsibility work, and our global focus on diversity and inclusion. Giving back and taking a stand on issues that matter are integral parts of IBM\u2019s long-term strategy and something we will strive to continue doing to the best of our ability in the future.",
  "Also, we engage in many co-development projects with our customers supporting their sustainability ambitions in such areas as reducing their climate and environmental impact, transitioning to a fossil-free future, food safety improvement, food waste reduction, ethical sourcing, plastic use reduction energy usage reduction, etc. In honor of last week\u2019s UN Day, we have published a white paper illustrating some of the highlights of how IBM is addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals from a global perspective.",
  "You can download it by clicking on the link below: Thought Leadership Report: IBM and the UN Sustainable Development Goals Report In a bit smaller geographical perspective, we also promised to highlight some of the cases or solutions that we have worked on (and successfully implemented) here in Denmark that align with the UN Development Goals. Firstly, we are deeply engaged in the efforts to educate and upskill individuals and communities. We believe that education and sustainable growth are key factors to a positive development in our world. We support underserved populations of young people and adults in need for digital education and we engage in mentor programs and workforce integration-oriented projects. P-TECH and Open P-TECH are examples of such schools and initiatives. We have for several years supported refugees and immigrants in Denmark, in partnership with \u2018Foreningen Nydansker\u2019 with mentoring and internships.",
  "In 2019 we hired four young refugees as student workers in IBM \u2013 helping to break their \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 in order to get a relevant student job and enter the labor market. Lastly, and as COVID-19 response, IBM has opened our IBM SkillsBuild up for all \u2013 free to use \u2013 for all people who now need to change career and thus needs to sharpen their digital skills.",
  "Another example is our collaboration with ReDI School for Digital Integration. ReDI is a non-profit tech school offering free IT-education on several levels to women with ethnic minority backgrounds. IBM Denmark contributes with content through the IBM SkillsBuild platform and voluntary instructors. The school and the model and program have shown to be very effective. After the latest 12-weeks course, 33% of the participants were engaged in internships, regular jobs, or on-going education. Secondly, we assist NGO\u2019s with technology and advisory services.",
  "One example we like to highlight is our collaboration with the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). Together with DRC, we have \u2013 pro bono \u2013 developed a software-model, \u2018Foresight\u2019, that based on machine learning and AI can support the prediction of, \u2013 and insight to future migration flows in the world.",
  "The objective is to enable DRC to be able to optimize and predict the needs for resources for specific locations and refugee crisis, and to become a scientific-based trusted advisor to governments and humanitarian intuitions in the world. The application is free and open source. Read more about the collaboration here. Thirdly, we would like to use the last paragraph in this blog on thanking IBM for giving all IBM\u2019ers the opportunity to participate in voluntary community services. By working in a company that supports such activities, we as employees can contribute to a better society by using our specific skills and expertise to help others. Over 10% of Danish IBM\u2019ers did that in 2019.",
  "That is certainly something we can be proud of. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at Sanne Urbak at urbak@dk.ibm.com or andersq@dk.ibm.com.",
  "We are also ready to discuss how we at IBM can contribute to your sustainability journey or your voluntary community service project.
