  "[1] The Goal has 17 targets to be achieved by 2030, broken down into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. Progress towards targets will be measured by 25 indicators. [2][3] SDG 17 refers to the need for cross sector and cross country collaboration in pursuit of all the goals by the year 2030. It is a call for countries to align policies. SDG 17 is a vision for improved and more equitable trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote sustainable development across borders. It is about strengthening and streamlining cooperation between nation-states, both developed and developing, using the SDGs as a shared framework and a shared vision for defining that collaborative way forward.",
  "[2] It seeks to promote international trade, and help developing countries increase their exports to ensure a universal rules-based and equitable trading system that is fair, open and beneficial to all. [4] With US$5 trillion to $7 trillion in annual investment required to achieve the SDGs, total official development assistance reached US$147.2 billion in 2017.",
  "This, although steady, is below the set target. [4] In 2016, six countries met the international target to keep official development assistance at or above 0.7 percent of gross national income. [4] In 2017, international remittances amounted US$613 billion, with 76 percent invested in developing countries. The bond market for sustainable business is also growing. In 2018 global green bonds reached US$155.5billion, up to 78 percent from 2017. [4] Humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters have continued to demand more financial resources and aid.",
  "Even so, many countries also require official development assistance to encourage growth and trade. [4] The global progress map for SDG 17 shows that significant and major challenges remain in the majority of the world.",
  "Many regions of strong economic status perform very poorly, like the United States and much of Europe.

  "[15][16] Despite the efforts to implement the support the implementation of the SDGs, this process has been fragile and has faced different challenges. From the absence of data to trade tensions and COVID-19, these challenges represent a threat for the progress made.",
  "[12] Links with other SDGs[edit] The success of the 2030 agenda requires inclusive partnerships to achieve the common goals adopted. These partnerships need to be set at the different constituencies (local, national, regional and global level) and consider the Sustainable Development Goals'principles, vision and values to place people and planet first now more than ever to recover from crisis and build back while achieving the SDGs. [10] More often than not, the actualization of the SDGs, at the global level, depends on the effectiveness of the official development assistance. The Official development assistance needs to leverage on international collaboration for the public financing of the developing countries that remained unfulfilled by the donors. It is the responsibility of the official development assistance to ensure that, most developing countries are supported in areas of water and sanitation related activities and programs rather than making use of their domestic resources, tariffs and public finance obtain through taxation. Challenges[edit] Impacts and responses to Covid-19 pandemic[edit] The UN Secretary-General gave a development of strategy that spread out a dream for how the global network can show a powerful, organized reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

  "[17] Unfortunately, remittances to low income countries are expected to fall and global investment is expected to decline by 40% owing to the pandemic. [18] World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the UN Establishment advanced a first-of-its-kind Solidarity Reaction Support to permit enterprises and people to contribute to WHO's COVID-19 reaction. [7] Partnerships with private finance[edit] There are concerns that Target 17.17 could undermine the rest of the SDGs. Indeed, according to a 2018 UN Report,[19] \"in terms of costs, private finance is more expensive than public finance, and public-private partnerships can also incur high design, management and transactional costs due to their complexity and the need for external advice\". [20][21] In addition, negotiations of these public-private partnerships can cause project delays of some years. [22] Organizations[edit] United Nations organizations[edit] The following United Nations organizations are involved in SDG 17, being custodians of one or several indicators: International Monetary Fund (IMF) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) World Bank (WB) UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNTAD) UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS) International Telecommunication Union (ITU) United Nations Environmental Programme-Climate Technology Centre and Network (UNEP-CTCN) World Trade Organization (WTO) International Trade Centre (ITC) United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA-UNSD) PARIS 21 The \"Business Avengers\"[edit] 17 of the world's largest corporations are part of those dedicated to achieving the SDG.",
  "[23] The opportunities for this \"business avenger\" concept include collective impact and employee engagement. The organization Salesforce.org (social impact center of Salesforce company) has committed to supporting SDG 17.",
  "[23] US Based Organizations[edit] In the US there are over fifteen thousand tax-exempt organizations working on issues related to UN SDG 17, according to data filed with the Internal Revenue Service \u2013IRS and aggregated by X4Impact. [24] X4Impact, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation,[25] Hewlett Foundation,[26] and Giving Tech Labs, created a free online interactive tool UN SDG Partnerships in the US. This online tool enables users to see indicators related to Official Development Assistance (ODA) Spending and local spending on issues related to the other SDGs nationally and by state, as well as relevant information for over fifteen thousand tax-exempt organizations in the US working on issues related to UN SDG 17. The nonprofit data in the tool is updated every 15 days while the indicators are updated annually.
