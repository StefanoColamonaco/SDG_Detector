Designed  with  everyone in\u00a0mind. Read more about our design. Designed  with  everyone in\u00a0mind. We\u2019ve always known that in order to create the most personal technology in the world, we must consider the full range of human\u00a0experiences. ",
  "Think outside the\u00a0screen. All across Apple there is a sustained commitment to making products more inclusive. ",
  "Apple accessibility engineers work hand in hand with a wide array of teams to help solve unique problems others seldom think about. For example, how does someone who\u2019s blind or low vision know when to move forward in line at a\u00a0cafe? The answer started with the video engineering team while working with the technology called LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). It uses a pulsed laser to \u201cping\u201d nearby objects to generate a 3D model of the surrounding environment, similar to how bats or dolphins use sound pulses to sense the world around\u00a0them. But what started as a prototype to make life more convenient became a necessity once COVID-19 hit. Our teams\u2019 ongoing conversations with the Blind community led to a more pressing issue: How does a blind or low-vision person practice social distancing? ",
  "Cross-team communication and collaboration rallied our teams so we could fast-track the LiDAR Scanner prototype to create what is now our People Detection feature. Improving lives is great, but helping to save lives is even\u00a0better. ",
  "Tu makes Apple Watch  more  accessible  for limb difference. Read more about Tu. Tu Nguyen\nHe/him, Senior Software Engineer, watchOS\n\n\n\nTu\u2019s journey at Apple started in college. When he wasn\u2019t poring through computer science books, he was working part time as an Apple\u00a0Store Specialist and Genius. As an engineer working with the watchOS Accessibility team, Tu helped create technology that enables people to do more with their lives, no matter their accessibility needs. quote by Tu\nI got into computer science and software engineering in general to see people use what I build. ",
  "And with AssistiveTouch in particular, it\u2019s not just them using it, it\u2019s enabling them to use the entire\u00a0thing. AssistiveTouch, which Tu\u2019s team led the development of for watchOS, helps people use Apple\u00a0Watch if they have difficulty touching the screen or pressing buttons. ",
  "It allows hand gestures and simple movements like tilting and using a clenched fist or pinched fingers to control the device and is especially helpful for people with limb differences. The years of work he put into the development process brought Tu closer to why he became an engineer. AssistiveTouch reflects not only his personal values, but a unique companywide commitment to accessibility. \u201cEveryone at Apple, including leadership, knows this is just the right thing to do. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t build for accessibility, so we do\u00a0it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re moving forward, together. We have more than 165,000 talented employees across the world, and many find fulfillment at Apple for many years. ",
  "We\u2019re making progress in increasing representation, and currently, 50 percent of our workforce in the U.S. is made up of people from underrepresented communities. Because even a 1 percent improvement impacts a substantial number of people, increasing overall representation takes time. ",
