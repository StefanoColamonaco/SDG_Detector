Story\n      \n\n          charity: water sought to expand its presence online using the free tools available through Google for Nonprofits. Interactive, social, analytic, and optimization tools help educate prospective donors while giving supporters visual proof of how their contributions make a direct impact. Using Google Maps, charity: water connects donors with their donation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 upon making a contribution, donors are sent a set of GPS coordinates and photos where they can track their donations and see the impact they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making. YouTube has allowed people involved with the water project to document its progress by providing a platform for the charity: water staff to send thank-you messages to donors or capture videos on-site to tell personal stories of how new water wells provided safe and clean drinkable water.

  "charity:water also uses Ad Grants to help increase organic and paid search results, creating campaigns like one that encouraged people to ask their friends and relatives to donate to charity: water instead of a traditional birthday gift. Our mission is to bring clean and safe drinking water to every single person on the planet, and with Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting closer every day. ",
