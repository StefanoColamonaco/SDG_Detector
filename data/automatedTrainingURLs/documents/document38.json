Women currently make up 29 per cent[1] of Australia\u2019s technology workforce. ",
  "While gender diversity has slowly improved, it is well shy of equality and there remains an 18 per cent gender pay gap in technology occupations. COVID-19 has magnified the challenge; according to a recent report from the Australian Academy of Science the pandemic is expected to disproportionately hinder women\u2019s STEM careers[2] and exacerbate female job insecurity. According to that report, Australia\u2019s women have been hardest hit in terms of job losses from professional, scientific and technical services businesses; jobs in this field were down 6.3 per cent for women and 4.8 per cent for men between mid-March and mid-April. This heightens the challenge facing the Male Champions of Change (MCC) Microsoft Partner Group which brings together tech sector leaders who are committed to achieving gender equality in the sector, finding innovative and disruptive ways to lower the barriers to entry to the sector, and supporting and enabling women in the workplace to thrive now and in the future. A group of Microsoft\u2019s largest partners, which combined employ tens of thousands of people, will be foundation members of the Group and include Data#3, Datacom, Dicker Data, Empired, Ingram Micro, Insight, Interactive, Rackspace, Synnex and Thomas Duryea Logicalis. Several more major Microsoft partners are members of other Male Champions of Change (MCC) groups already, and we welcome others who are interested to join. ",
  "Steven Worrall, managing director of Microsoft Australia will sponsor the MCC Microsoft Partner Group which includes CEOs or MDs of the foundation partners. All have committed their time and significant investment to the group. ",
  "According to Worrall; \u201cMicrosoft is working with the MCC to pioneer this first ever Champions of Change group created within a single company\u2019s ecosystem. There are more than 10,000 Microsoft partners operating in Australia, employing 300,000 people \u2013 this is an important step toward ensuring a much greater proportion of those employees are women in the future. \u201cThat is critically important as digital transformation of Australian industries, education, healthcare, government and society accelerates. We need greater diversity of thought and lived experience to ensure that the solutions being deployed meet the needs of all of us. \u201cI\u2019m proud that so many of our partners are invested in creating positive change in gender equality in their organisations and within the broader ICT ecosystem. MCC provides a platform to drive disruptive action across the whole of the tech sector and create better workplaces for everyone.\u201d\nWorrall added that finding ways to encourage gender diversity is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. ",
  "\u201cResearch reveals that gender diverse companies are 15 per cent more likely to financially outperform[3] male-dominated peers while in Australia, the Grattan Institute has estimated that adding 6 per cent more women to the workforce could add $25 billion to our GDP[4],\u201d he said. Elizabeth Broderick, former Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner and founder of Male Champions of Change said; \u201cThe Male Champions of Change strategy is about male leaders stepping up beside women to lead with action to advance gender equality. ",
  "While no two MCC groups are identical \u2013 being shaped by business, social, and industry considerations \u2013 they all have at their heart a deep commitment to driving diversity and inclusion. \u201cThis approach is a major innovation \u2013 where leaders within a business eco-system are taking charge to change that system. Technology is transforming every industry on earth. It is critically important that women are part of that transformation.\u201d\nVlad Mitnovetski, CEO, Dicker Data said: \u201cThe entire working landscape has fundamentally changed because of COVID-19 \u2013 but the challenges associated with ensuring gender diversity are if anything magnified. As we emerge from this pandemic, there is a real opportunity to reset our workplaces, to build in greater flexibility, create new career pathways and increase opportunities for women. \u201cWe have established working groups to look at these priority areas and find ways to enact important and necessary change,\u201d he added. ",
  "Globally, Microsoft\u2019s commitment is a 1 per cent increase every year in employing women. This MCC cohort will commit to similar goals to improve the gender diversity within the ICT industry in Australia. ",
  "Rachel Bondi, Chief Partner Officer, Microsoft Australia and Co-Chair of the Male Champions of Change (MCC) Microsoft Partner Group said that the group\u2019s formation was critically important given the challenges women were facing during the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cThe first meeting of the group decided to fast track on three priority action areas \u2013 building flexible workplaces, developing new approaches to attracting and retaining women in the sector, and leveraging equality to encourage successful transformation. Working together we can have an important multiplier effect and help to accelerate the entire Australian tech sector\u2019s drive for inclusion and diversity. \u201cAs more of our partners come on board, the conversation regarding the importance of tech sector diversity and inclusion will be amplified; new programs to encourage women into the sector will emerge; capability will improve and corporate cultures will become more inclusive. Together we can strive for gender equality across our industry and serve as a diversity beacon for other sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 of 3                                        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Bondi, Chief Partner Officer, One Commercial Partner, Microsoft Australia                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2 of 3                                        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteven Worrall, Managing Director - Microsoft Australia                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3 of 3                                        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Broderick, Founder - Male Champions of Change                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Male Champions of Change\nMale Champions of Change is an Australian not for profit institute focused on achieving gender equality, advancing women in leadership and building respectful and inclusive workplaces.
