Exercise is clinically proven to improve mental health by improving self-esteem and cognitive function, as well as reducing the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and negative moods. Nike, which can lay credible claim to being an expert in movement and exercise, is introducing the NIke Mind Sets program and platform in partnership with creative agency AnalogFolk to inspire and uplift users throughout the brand\u2019s extensive ecosystem by helping them \u201cmove\u201d in any way that feels good and prioritizes and improves their mental wellbeing.
