We were the first company of our size to achieve this milestone back in 2017, and we\u2019ve repeated the accomplishment in every year since. ",
  "All told, we\u2019ve signed agreements to buy power from more than 50 renewable energy projects, with a combined capacity of 5.5 gigawatts \u2013 about the same as a million solar rooftops.Achieving 100 percent renewable energy year after year is no easy feat, because the amount of computing done in Google data centers continues to grow. This was especially true in 2020 \u2013 a year when many peoples\u2019 work, school, doctor\u2019s appointments, first dates, and visits with loved ones moved online. Even as Google Meet and Duo hosted over a\u00a0trillion minutes of video calls\u00a0in 2020, our renewable energy procurement kept pace.The path to 100% starts with reducing the amount of energy we use in the first place. Researchers recently found that worldwide data center electricity\u00a0stayed close to flat in the last decade, even as computing needs grew 550 percent. And Google has led this trend: compared with five years ago, we now deliver around\u00a0seven times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.Last year\u2019s accomplishment was also due to a\u00a0global package of renewable energy deals\u00a0that we announced in late 2019. As those projects came online over the course of 2020, hundreds of new turbines and hundreds of thousands of new solar panels began converting wind and sun into electrons.Our renewable energy projects that started operations in 2020 spanned four continents. ",
  "Some highlights we\u2019re especially excited about:\u00a0\u00a0Google\u2019s first offshore wind project, in the blustery North Sea, began contributing electrons to the grid where we operate our Belgium data center.In Chile, we began purchasing power\u00a0 from a new solar farm in the Antofagasta region\u00a0 to match our growing load in South America. Solar panels distributed across hundreds of public housing rooftops helped us source new clean energy in land-constrained Singapore.Across the U.S., large-scale solar and wind projects gave a boost to data centers from Oklahoma to Alabama to Virginia. ",
  "So what\u2019s next? Though we\u2019re thrilled to have matched Google\u2019s annual electricity consumption with renewable energy for four years running, we\u2019re now building on our progress to target an even larger ambition: by 2030, Google aims to run on entirely 24/7 carbon-free energy, everywhere we operate. As we discuss in a new explainer, achieving this goal means shifting away from a net-zero model of \u201cemit and compensate\u201d and instead targeting \u201cabsolute zero,\u201d where we simply never emit carbon from our operations in the first place. Solving this challenge is not only important for Google, but will also be essential for fully transitioning electric grids to carbon-free energy. We hope our efforts to develop solutions for our own operations can lead the way.
