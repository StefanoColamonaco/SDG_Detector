This week, the tech giant finally released its\u00a0strategy\u00a0detailing how it plans to achieve this ambitious goal by 2030. ",
  "The objective, which Google calls \"24/7 carbon-free energy,\" is to match clean energy generation to the company\u2019s energy loads in real time everywhere it operates by 2030. This goes beyond traditional corporate\u00a0100 percent renewable energy goals, where companies buy clean energy capacity equivalent to their annual consumption \u2014 regardless of when, where or what season it is generated. Powering operations solely from clean energy in real time is no small feat, and it has had its share of\u00a0doubters. It is also key to decarbonizing electricity. \"This is our biggest sustainability moonshot yet, with enormous practical and technical complexity,\" wrote Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai in a\u00a0blog. \u201cWe are the first major company that's set out to do this, and we aim to be the first to achieve it.\u201d\u00a0\nIf Google figures out how to do this cost efficiently and effectively, it could create a model for states, utilities and other companies to follow suit. ",
  "How to match clean energy supply and demand\nThe details of Google\u2019s plan are still vague. The tech giant said in a\u00a0blog\u00a0that its strategy will include aspects of what I consider to be the four\u00a0buckets\u00a0of time and location matching:\n\nDiversifying clean energy resources\u00a0to decrease the amount of time of lulls in electricity generation. ",
  "This could include wind for when solar stops, along with hydro and geothermal for base loads. Store energy\u00a0to save clean energy for when it\u2019s needed. This solution is obvious, but also still expensive to do at scale. Shift loads\u00a0by aligning energy-intensive activities to when renewables are plentiful. This could include demand response programs or scheduling non-essential, energy intensive functions to when clean energy is available. Overbuild clean energy resources\u00a0and curtail excess energy when supply outstrips demand. ",
  "This is a cheaper option than energy storage in many situations. Key to Google\u2019s ambition is how far clean energy technologies have come \u2014 and how rapidly they\u2019re becoming better and cheaper. ",
  "Google\u2019s strategy\u00a0cites\u00a0the falling cost of renewables and energy storage technologies, the improvements in demand response technologies, and new policies working to clean the grid. Google also highlighted the role of artificial intelligence in optimizing its electricity demand and forecasting, including a\u00a0machine learning system\u00a0it uses that can predict power output from farms 36 hours in advance. Key to Google\u2019s ambition is how far clean energy technologies have come \u2014 and how rapidly they\u2019re becoming better and cheaper. Will other companies follow suit? Google has long been a trendsetter in clean energy. A brief timeline of Google\u2019s clean energy accomplishments:\u00a0\n\n2007: Google became \"carbon neutral\" by offsetting the emissions it generates from fossil fuels\n2017: Google became the first major company to reach 100 percent clean energy procurement\n2018: Google publishes a\u00a0whitepaper\u00a0on 24/7 carbon-free energy at its datacenters, popularizing the idea of time and location matching\u00a0\n2019: Google inked the largest clean energy procurement to date with\u00a01.6-gigawatts of capacity\u00a0spread across 18 individual projects in four countries\n\nThese initiatives can seem daunting to other corporates that don\u2019t enjoy the same size, reach and resources. ",
  "But being a trendsetter, by definition, means others get on board with the trend. After all,\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of companies signed on to 100 percent clean energy commitments after Google. ",
  "Kyle Harrison, a senior associate with BloombergNEF, says few companies have the margins to figure out how to procure around the clock clean energy. \"I do not see any other companies doing this in the immediate term,\" Harrison told\u00a0Utility Dive. \"There is an opportunity here for Google to play around with some things, and for other companies to take those best practices and apply them.\" Google isn\u2019t the only company trying time and location matching\u00a0\nTime and location matching for clean energy is not all or nothing. Other companies have been playing around with matching energy loads with real-time clean energy generation, and in every instance organizations are uncovering new partnerships, technologies and strategies that will make it easier for others to follow suit. Notably, last year\u00a0Microsoft and Vattenfall\u00a0partnered on an hour-by-hour renewable power matching in Sweden. ",
  "Daimler and Statkraft also signed a PPA in January where the carmaker\u2019s German operations will get 100 percent clean energy in real-time, supplementing wind and solar with hydropower. Microsoft is also getting bullish on its ability to decarbonize its data centers. ",
  "In January, the software giant pledged to power all data centers with renewables by\u00a02025, and in July the company said it plans to stop using diesel generators for back-up energy by\u00a02030. It also is investing in green\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0to power data centers. EDF Renewables North America is betting more organizations will begin to prioritize time and location matching, and recently launched a product called\u00a0GTECH\u00a0\u2014 or \"green technology energy credit hourly.\" The instrument aims to provide time and location matched clean energy to companies, thereby creating a market. Other organizations offer similar products, including\u00a0Drift Energy. This movement shows that offtakers have an appetite to go beyond procuring 100 percent clean energy on an annual basis to matching loads with carbon-free energy in real time. ",
  "Three things I\u2019ll be watching:\u00a0\nI appreciate that Google will be figuring out how to achieve this plan as it goes. Here are three things I\u2019ll be watching as its strategy crystalizes:\u00a0\n\nHow Google will address scope 3 emissions. ",
  "The current plan doesn\u2019t make mention of\u00a0Scope 3 emissions, those that come from the supply chain. In the case of Google, this includes the manufacturing of its Pixel phones. I\u2019ll be watching how, and if, Google decarbonizes up and downstream. What AI technologies may support other companies and communities. Earlier this year, Google launched a \"carbon-intelligent computing platform,\" software that helped data centers shift non-essential computing tasks to times renewables were plentiful. I\u2019ll be watching what other software the tech giant will develop, and how it can support other localities reach deep decarbonization. ",
  "If and how the company will get involved in policy. Google\u2019s\u00a0blog\u00a0says one aspect that will make its goal achievable is \"the right government policies.\" ",
  "Given Google\u2019s substantial reach and influence, I\u2019ll be watching if the company will push for policies that will help clean.
