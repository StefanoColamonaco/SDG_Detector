IBM has long understood that investing in a culture of health makes sense for both its employees and its business.",
  "Our commitment to employee health, well-being and safety dates to the early history of the company. IBM established a leadership position on workplace safety even before Thomas J. Watson Jr. issued our first formal policy in 1967. In 1932, Thomas J. Watson Sr., IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first president and general manager, told the Third Annual Greater New York Safety Conference: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSafety is a matter of individual responsibility for each factory, for each establishment, for each president, for each executive, for each foreman and for each worker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Today, employee well-being continues to be incorporated into every aspect of IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global business, from our strategic and business planning to operations, as reflected in our vision statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerformance is optimized through healthy choices, people, workplaces, families and communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our work to realize this vision is guided by five mission statements: Provide safe and healthy work environments. Improve the overall health of our employees. Design health benefits and health promotion programs to improve access, increase quality, reduce costs and drive innovation. Support business continuity and results.",
  "Address local and global health priorities. Our goal of building and maintaining a healthy global workforce is contingent upon the personal health and resilience of IBMers.",
  "Employees who are safe, healthy, mentally resilient and physically fit tend to experience better quality of life and higher personal productivity, and those who discover health problems early tend to get well faster and spend less on medical care. IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Corporate Health & Safety organization \u00e2\u0080\u0094 encompassing occupational health, industrial hygiene, safety, and wellness professionals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is responsible for implementing proactive, values-based practices, programs and policies that effectively manage the complex, diverse and ever-changing health and safety needs of IBMers worldwide.

IBM's corporate policy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Culture of Health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the cornerstone of IBM's HSMS, which follows the \"plan-do-check-act\" principles that are common in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) consensus standards. This systematic approach involves a \"planning, implementation, evaluation and review\" cycle that monitors and audits well-being requirements and improvement objectives.",
  "It also provides a process for corrective or preventive health and safety actions that are integral to IBM business processes. The management system is implemented throughout all of IBM's business units worldwide via a tiered structure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the top tier consists of activities carried out globally, linked to a second tier organized by geographical unit, location or business line.",
  "The HSMS ensures that performance improvement is linked to evolving business priorities while enabling continual improvement in employee health and well-being, as well as control of health and safety risks that can impact business operations. Each year a strategic planning process considers new global objectives, which are then translated into relevant initiatives with the flexibility to accommodate distinct health and safety requirements at a local level. The system is regularly reviewed for efficacy, efficiency and consistency, with input from management, employees and other external reviewers. Recognition of excellence: ISO45001 Certification External certification of IBM's HSMS has been beneficial in improving the quality and consistency of global implementation. It has also enabled IBM to fulfill marketplace demands and foster business opportunity, because the company is more readily able to demonstrate its standardized approach to managing employee well-being to clients and potential customers. In addition, certification aligns with IBM's priority to accelerate global integration via recognized management systems.",
  "In 2019, following evaluation by a third-party auditor, IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s HSMS obtained corporation-wide certification to the ISO45001:2018 standard. IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global certification is based on a three-year cycle, with a certification audit in the first year and surveillance audits in the second and third years.",
  "Global workplace safety IBM's commitment to workplace safety was formalized decades ago. Today, our safety record is among the best in the industry.
