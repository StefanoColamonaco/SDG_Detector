On 1st January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda officially came into force. These goals cover the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The Encyclopedia of the UN Sustainable Development Goals comprehensively addresses the SDGs in an integrated way. It encompasses 17 volumes, each one devoted to one of the 17 SDGs. This volume addresses SDG 12, namely \"Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\" and contains the description of a range of terms, which allows a better understanding and fosters knowledge. ",
  "Concretely, the defined targets are:Implement the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countriesAchieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resourcesHalve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest lossesAchieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environmentSubstantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuseEncourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cyclePromote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities Ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and productionDevelop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and productsRationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communitiesEditorial BoardMedani P.
