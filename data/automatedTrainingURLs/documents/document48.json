Part of this ambition is Adobe\u2019s goal to be 100% powered by renewable electricity and with its partnership with Enel Green Power, the tech leader is on its way to running entirely on clean energy.

As a member of\u00a0RE100, Adobe has committed to be\u00a0100% powered by renewables\u00a0by 2035\u00a0and is choosing to enter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) to help meet this goal. One of the PPAs furthering Adobe\u2019s renewable energy strategy is with Enel Green Power at the Rattlesnake Creek wind farm in Nebraska. Rattlesnake Creek is a testament to the power of working together. In addition to the power purchase agreement with Adobe, the wind farm is supporting Facebook with wind energy as well. By using a collaborative approach to find power purchase solutions for two companies with different energy needs, Rattlesnake Creek is enabling the technology companies to make significant progress on their renewable energy targets. ",
  "The PPAs at Rattlesnake Creek represent the technology industry\u2019s first aggregated purchase of wind energy. Until 2029, the companies will share the output of the wind project, with Adobe purchasing the energy produced by 10 MW of Rattlesnake Creek and Facebook purchasing the energy produced by the remaining 310 MW of the project. ",
  "Adobe believes that when it comes to the environment, collaboration is the only way forward. And at Enel Green Power, we couldn\u2019t agree more. {{item.label}}\n\n\n\n{{ item.title }}\n\n{{ item.content }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy 10\n\nEnergy\n10\nMW of sustainable energy\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation 1st\n\nInnovation\n1st\nAggregated purchase of wind energy for the technology industry\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions 29k\n\nEmissions\n29k\nTons of CO2 emissions avoided each year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle-{{_uid}}\n\n\n                Sustainability Highlights\n            \nAn Award-Winning Partnership\nFor the past three years, Smart Energy Decisions has held an Innovation Awards competition,\u00a0recognizing exemplary use of innovative technologies and progressive practices among large electric power users and their suppliers.
