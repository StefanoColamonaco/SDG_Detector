The company is specifically working toward Target 8.2, which focuses on using technological innovation to achieve higher levels of economic productivity. ",
  "Microsoft emphasizes in their 2021 SDG Report that promoting decent work is not only critical for SDG 8, but is also key in alleviating poverty and promoting good health. As an organization that employs over 150,000 people globally, Microsoft views itself as being in a prime position to bolster equitable and inclusive growth.Microsoft believes that a key part of expanding decent work opportunities is increasing human capital. In line with this idea, the company launched Microsoft Career Connector to help job seekers enter the tech industry. This program followed the company\u2019s 2020 Global Skills Initiative, which set a goal of helping 25 million people across the globe gain digital skills. Microsoft developed game-based learning for younger students and has partnered with LinkedIn in developing Career Coach, an app for students in higher education to discover their career path and build the necessary skills for that career. Microsoft is also working to expand human capital in developing regions, particularly through their 4Afrika Initiative that they launched in 2013. ",
  "Through the initiative, Microsoft is investing in African areas to increase internet access and bolster startups. Ultimately, the company aims to help African communities expand their existing markets and find technological solutions to locally relevant issues.To advance economic opportunities, Microsoft has formed several strategic partnerships in the past few years. ",
  "In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Microsoft partnered with the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other technology companies, like IBM, to create the Global Skills Academy. The academy focuses on increasing opportunities for digital upskilling and helps people gain access to training materials that will benefit their employability. Part of the Global Skills Academy curriculum comes from Microsoft Learn for Students and Educators, which provides entry-level technology courses and works on building professional skills, targeting the Middle East and Africa.
