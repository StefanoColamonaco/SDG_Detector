It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. [3] Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation. [4][5]\nRenewable energy often provides energy for: electricity generation to a grid, air and water heating/cooling, and stand-alone power systems. ",
  "About 20% of humans' global energy consumption is renewables, including almost 30% of electricity. [6] About 8% of energy consumption is traditional biomass, but this is declining. ",
  "[7] Over 4% of energy consumption is heat energy from modern renewables, such as solar water heating, and over 6% electricity. [7]\nGlobally there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer. [8] Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing,[9] with a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity being renewable. [10] In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity. [11]\nMany nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of their energy supply, with some generating over half their electricity from renewables. [12] National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the 2020s and beyond. ",
  "[13]\nA few countries generate all their electricity using renewable energy. [14]\nRenewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. ",
  "Deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits. [15] However renewables are being hindered by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies. [16] In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for renewables such as solar power and wind power. [17][18] But the International Energy Agency said in 2021 that to reach net zero carbon emissions more effort is needed to increase renewables, and called for generation to increase by about 12% a year to 2030. [6]\nRenewable energy technology projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. [19][20] As most of the renewable energy technologies provide electricity, renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can be converted to heat, can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency, and is clean at the point of consumption. ",
  "[21][22] In addition, electrification with renewable energy is more efficient and therefore leads to significant reductions in primary energy requirements. [23] In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the increase in renewable electricity. ",
  "[24]  In 2021, Norway, known for its production of hydroelectricity, consumed hydro energy worth 45% of its total energy supply.

[26]\n PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar-powered boat and the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe (in 2012)\nRenewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight, wind, tides, plant growth, and geothermal heat, as the International Energy Agency explains:[27]\n\nRenewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources. Renewable energy stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they are being replenished. ",
  "Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits. ",
  "[15] Economically, there has been a decrease in the cost of the technologies behind many of these renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. [28] In some cases it will be cheaper to transition to these sources as opposed to continuing to use the current, inefficient, fossil fuels. It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that could amount to trillions of dollars annually. [29][30] Multiple analyses of decarbonization strategies have found that quantified health benefits can significantly offset the costs of implementing these strategies. [31][32] Renewable energy sources, that derive their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly, such as hydro and wind, are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years, at which point the predicted increase in heat from the Sun is expected to make the surface of the Earth too hot for liquid water to exist. [33][34][35]\nClimate change and global warming concerns, coupled with the continuing fall in the costs of some renewable energy equipment, such as wind turbines and solar panels, are driving increased use of renewables. ",
  "[17] New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors. [36] As of 2019[update], however, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables overall share in the energy mix (including power, heat and transport) needs to grow six times faster, in order to keep the rise in average global temperatures \"well below\" 2.0\u00a0\u00b0C (3.6\u00a0\u00b0F) during the present century, compared to pre-industrial levels. ",
  "[37]\nAs of 2011, small solar PV systems provide electricity to a few million households, and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more. [needs update] Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves. [38] United Nations' eighth Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity. [39] At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. [40] Although many countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy these tend to be only for the power sector,[41] including a 40% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2030. [42]\nRenewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services:[43]\n\nPower generation\nMore than a quarter of electricity is generated from renewables. ",
  "[44]\nHeating and cooling\nSolar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180\u00a0 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50\u201360 million households in China. ",
  "Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority[45][46] Renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly. [47] About 10% of heating and cooling energy is from renewables. [44]\nTransportation\n A bus fueled by biodiesel\nOne of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles (EVs). ",
  "[48]\nDespite that and the use of biofuels, such as biojet, less than 4% of transport energy is from renewables. [44]\nHistory[edit]\nPrior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. ",
  "The oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago. The use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later. [49] Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile. [50] From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times. [51] Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor, animal power, water power, wind, in grain crushing windmills, and firewood, a traditional biomass. ",
  "In 1885, Werner von Siemens, commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state, wrote:\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten. [52]\nMax Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905. ",
  "[53] Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 Scientific American article: \"in the far distant future, natural fuels having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race\". [54]\nThe theory of peak oil was published in 1956. [55] In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared. Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980. [56]\nSince the 21st century, many parts of the world have transitioned to sources of renewable energy from fossil fuels. ",

  "[61] The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay. Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations. [62]\nRun-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. ",
  "This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River in the United States. [63] Many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants. ",
  "Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. Of the top 50 countries by percentage of electricity generated from renewables, 46 are primarily hydroelectric. [64] China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10\u00a0GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. [65]\nWave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. According to the Energy Information Administration, the theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatthours, or the equivalent of about 66% of U.S. electricity generation in 2020. ",
  "[66]  A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of the world's highest tidal flow. Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility. ",

Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600\u00a0kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. [74] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. ",
  "Typically, full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites. [75]\nWind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63\u00a0GW of new wind power capacity installed. ",
  "Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. [76]\nGlobally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.

[82][83] Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. ",
  "Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect. [84] Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP. [85][86] Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. ",
  "CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies. In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that \"the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. ",
  "It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared\". [82] Solar power accounts for 505 GW annually, which is about 2% of the world's electricity. Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions, geographic location and time of day. [87] According to chapter 6 of the IPCC 2022 climate mitigation report, the global potential of direct solar energy far exceeds that of any other renewable energy resource. ",
  "It is well beyond the total amount of energy needed in order to support mitigation over the current century. [88]  Australia has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world, supplying 9.9% of the country's electrical demand in 2020. ",

It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass. [93] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood was the largest biomass energy source as of 2012;[94] examples include forest residues \u2013 such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps \u2013, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. ",
  "Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo,[95] and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil). Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy. ",
  "[96] The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel. Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as methane gas[97] or transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas\u00a0\u2013 also called landfill gas or biogas. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats. ",
  "[98] There is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it is a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. ",
  "The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the United Kingdom. [99][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nBiofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass. The term covers solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. ",
  "[100] Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include biogas, landfill gas and synthetic gas. ",
  "Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum. The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa. [101]\nWith advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil. ",
  "The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the European Environment Agency, biofuels do not address global warming concerns. ",
  "[102] Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils, animal fats or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010. [103][needs update]\nBiomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SOx), nitrous oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass. ",

  "Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals (in currently uncertain[109] but possibly roughly equal[110] proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and thermos, meaning heat. The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core\u00a0\u2013 4,000 miles (6,400\u00a0km) down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000\u00a0\u00b0F (5,000\u00a0\u00b0C). ",
  "Heat conducts from the core to the surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. ",
  "Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 700\u00a0\u00b0F (371\u00a0\u00b0C). [111]\nLow temperature geothermal[45] refers to the use of the outer crust of the Earth as a thermal battery to facilitate renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of geothermal, a geothermal heat pump and ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the Earth (for cooling) and out of the Earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low-temperature geothermal (generally referred to as \"GHP\") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. Thus low temperature geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support[112] and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy. ",

[113]\nThere are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large-scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields. [114]\nMultiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years.

[118] EGS technologies \"enhance\" and/or create geothermal resources in this \"hot dry rock (HDR)\" through hydraulic fracturing. EGS and HDR technologies, such as hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3\u20135\u00a0km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss.

The term marine energy encompasses wave power\u00a0\u2013 power from surface waves, marine current power - power from marine kydrokinetic streams (e.g., the Gulf Stream), and tidal power\u00a0\u2013 obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016, it is being tested at a small scale (50\u00a0kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. ",

  "A small number of such systems exist in France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United States. [124][125][126][127][128] The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land. ",
  "The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion. [129] In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477\u00a0kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.

[edit]\nA perovskite solar cell (PSC) is a type of solar cell which includes a perovskite-structured compound, most commonly a hybrid organic-inorganic lead or tin halide-based material, as the light-harvesting active layer. [136][137] Perovskite materials, such as methylammonium lead halides and all-inorganic cesium lead halide, are cheap to produce and simple to manufacture. Solar cell efficiencies of laboratory-scale devices using these materials have increased from 3.8% in 2009[138] to 25.7% in 2021 in single-junction architectures,[139][140] and, in silicon-based tandem cells, to 29.8%,[139][141] exceeding the maximum efficiency achieved in single-junction silicon solar cells. Perovskite solar cells have therefore been the fastest-advancing solar technology as of 2016[update]. ",

  "[142]\nSolar-assisted heat pump[edit]\nMain article: Solar-assisted heat pump\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water. [143] In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator. [144] The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way. ",
  "It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduces the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system.

Currently, flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries. Electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957. [146][147] The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.

  "The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow the development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture. A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the Vortex engine which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure. Space-based solar power[edit]\nMain article: Space-based solar power\nFor either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit. To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less. ",

[177]\n\nDeveloping countries[edit]\nMain article: Renewable energy in developing countriesThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2019)\n Solar cookers use sunlight as an energy source for outdoor cooking. Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, however between 2016 and 2017, investments in renewable energy were higher in developing countries than in developed countries, with China leading global investment with a record 126.6 billion dollars. ",
  "Many Latin American and African countries increased their investments significantly as well. [209] \nRenewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. ",
  "In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. [210]\nTechnology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who do not have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. [211] As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. ",
  "[212] Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 1[213] 2 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. ",
  "Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability. Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves. [38] Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulosic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique. ",
  "[214]\nRenewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. ",
  "Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. [215]\n\nPolicy[edit]\nPolicies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion. Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy. [216]\n\nPolicy trends[edit]\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, by 75\u00a0countries signing the charter of IRENA. ",
  "[217] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160\u00a0member states. [218] The then United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity,[39] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy. ",
  "[219]\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies. [13] In 2017, a total of 121 countries have adapted some form of renewable energy policy. [216] National targets that year existed in at 176 countries. [13] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels. [103] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades. Many national, state, and local governments have created green banks. ",
  "A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies. [220] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. ",
  "Climate neutrality by the year of 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal. [221] For the European union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise their energy system by aiming to achieve \"net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \"[222]\n\nFull renewable energy[edit]\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from 100% renewable energy. [edit]\n100% renewable energy means getting all energy from renewable resources. The endeavor to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, heating, cooling and transport is motivated by climate change, pollution and other environmental issues, as well as economic and energy security concerns, but some say this is not the best way to a global low-carbon economy. [223] Shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system, since most of today's energy is derived from non-renewable fossil fuels. ",
  "Research into this topic is fairly new, with very few studies published before 2009, but has gained increasing attention in recent years. The majority of studies show that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors \u2013 power, heat, transport and desalination is feasible and economically viable. ",
  "[224] While there are still many publications that focus on electricity only, there is a growing number of papers that cover different energy sectors and sector-coupled, integrated energy systems. This cross-sectoral, holistic approach is seen as an important feature of 100% renewable energy systems and is based on the assumption \"that the best solutions can be found only if one focuses on the synergies between the sectors\" of the energy system such as electricity, heat, transport or industry. [224]\n\nThe main barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low-carbon energy strategies are seen to be primarily social and political rather than technological or economic. [225] According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints. [226] Some argue that transitioning to 100% renewable energy would be too slow to limit climate change, and that closing down nuclear power stations is a mistake. [227][228]\nDebate[edit]\nMain articles: Renewable energy debate, Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy, Green job, and Intermittent power source\nFurther information: Climate change mitigation \u00a7\u00a0Overviews, strategies and comparisons of measures\nRenewable electricity generation by wind and solar is variable. ",
  "This results in reduced capacity factor and may require keeping some gas-fired power plants on standby[229][230][231] until there is enough energy storage, demand response, grid improvement, dispatchable generation and/or base load power from non-intermittent sources like hydropower, nuclear power or bioenergy. Solar power plants may compete with arable land,[232][233] while on-shore wind farms face opposition due to aesthetic concerns and noise, which is impacting both humans and wildlife. ",
  "[234][235][236] In the United States, the Massachusetts Cape Wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has enhanced the area. [237] These concerns, when directed against renewable energy, are sometimes described as \"not in my back yard\" attitude (NIMBY). A 2011 UK Government document states that \"projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake\". ",
  "[238] In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through cooperative structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment. [239][240]\nThe market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. ",
  "Climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, oil wars, oil spills, promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization. [17][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors. [36]\nThe International Energy Agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. [241]\nIn October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested \"the best answer\" to the 2021 global energy crisis is \"to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. \"[242] He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so \"for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests. \"[242] Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis. ",
  "[243][244][245] European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is \"too reliant\" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports. According to Von der Leyen, \"The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ... and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy. ",
  "\"[246]\n\nGeopolitics of renewable energy[edit]\nSee also: Russia in the European energy sector\n A concept of a super grid. From around 2010 onwards, the geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy has been discussed. [247] Some argue that former fossil fuels exporters will experience a weakening of their position in international affairs, while countries with abundant renewable energy resources will be strengthened. [248] Also some countries rich in critical materials for renewable energy technologies are expected to rise in importance in international affairs. [249][250]\nThe GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources. Former fossil fuels exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen. ",
  "[251]\nSeveral requirements and decisions that may be tied with geopolitical considerations are the sourcing of required materials, ownership of key infrastructure assets and the design of grids, including super grids. [252][253][254][255][256][257][excessive citations]\nTransitions to renewable energy have many geopolitical implications such as the potential of revenue losses to lead to political instability in insufficiently prepared fossil-fuel-exporting economies, albeit it is unclear whether the transition will increase or reduce conflict overall. ",
  "In particular, a study hypothesizes that a \"configuration emerges in which fossil fuel importers are better off decarbonizing, competitive fossil fuel exporters are better off flooding markets and uncompetitive fossil fuel producers\u2014rather than benefitting from 'free-riding'\u2014suffer from their exposure to stranded assets and lack of investment in decarbonization technologies\". [258][259]\nA study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel \u2013 they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction. [260]\nNations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters. [261]\nTrade in hydrogen could fundamentally redraw the geography of the global energy trade, and international governance and investments that seek to scale up the hydrogen economy could reduce \"the risk of market fragmentation, carbon lock-in, and intensified geo-economic rivalry\". [262][261][263]\n\nEnvironmental impact[edit]\nFurther information: Rare-earth element \u00a7\u00a0Environmental considerations\nRenewable sources other than biomass such as wind power, photovoltaics, and hydroelectricity have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce CO2 emissions. Solar panels change the albedo of the surface, so if used on a very large scale (such as covering 20% of the Sahara Desert), could change global weather patterns. ",
  "[264]\n\nBiomass[edit]\nFurther information: Biomass \u00a7\u00a0Environmental damage\nThe ability of biomass and biofuels to contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply. Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water[265] and land (sometimes land that could be used for food production). ",
  "[266][267] Furthermore, there can be carbon leakage from biomass production. [267] Nevertheless, it could still help reduce carbon dioxide emissions[268] and play an important role as a method of dispatchable generation. [269][270][271][272][273]\n\nConservation areas, recycling and rare-earth elements[edit]\nSee also: Environmental aspects of the electric car\nThe transition to renewable energy depends on non-renewable resources, such as mined metals. [232]\nInstallations used to produce wind, solar and hydropower are an increasing threat to key conservation areas, with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas. They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts. [274] More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe. ",
  "The authors' team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions. The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity. ",
  "[275]\nManufacturing of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and batteries requires significant amounts of rare-earth elements[276] which has significant social and environmental impact if mined in forests and protected areas. [277]  Due to co-occurrence of rare-earth and radioactive elements (thorium, uranium and radium), rare-earth mining results in production of low-level radioactive waste. [278]\nIn 2020 scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with \"Key Biodiversity Areas\", \"Remaining Wilderness\" and \"Protected Areas\". The authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed. [279][280][281]Solar panels are recycled to reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined,[282] but such business is still small and work is ongoing to improve and scale-up the process.
