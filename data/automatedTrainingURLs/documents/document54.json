We all must take action to reach net zero emissions. ",
  "Microsoft has a long history of action on climate and sustainability issues, and one of the most ambitious corporate plans to reduce and remove its own emissions. We recognize the need for strong policy action in the U.S. to ensure a continued vibrant national economy and achieve our shared climate goals. Microsoft has been working with\u00a0other\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0and conveying to members of Congress our support for strong climate and clean energy-related investments in both the infrastructure and reconciliation packages. As Congress\u00a0assembles\u00a0the reconciliation package,\u00a0it is critical that\u00a0legislation\u00a0promotes\u00a0the development of innovative technologies, provides\u00a0greater assistance to projects that remove carbon dioxide, applies\u00a0federal purchasing power to clean procurement and invests\u00a0in climate equity for frontline and disadvantaged communities. These measures, in addition to the climate and energy components of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, such as modernizing the grid, accelerating clean energy and strengthening resilience to the impacts of a changing climate, will be essential to the global climate stabilization goal we must all work together to achieve. At the center of all this progress, we must ensure that future policies drive common definitions of what is meant by\u00a0net zero\u00a0climate action, standardized measurements of the climate impacts of investments and tools for rapidly maturing the markets for carbon reduction and removal solutions that the world will need moving forward. ",
  "We are committed to working with Congress, the administration and a diverse set of stakeholders to support policies that dramatically reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions in an economically positive, market-oriented manner.
