  "At IBM, we call upon our global expertise to outthink the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toughest challenges to education, economic development and the prosperity they generate. To address the growing skills gap, IBM has created an innovative grade 9 to 14 schools model that is influencing national and global actions to create public-private partnerships with the power to transform economies. Designed by IBM, the program enables students to navigate a clear pathway from school to college and career. We also are developing the means for cognitive computing to help teachers improve their teaching, which is connected directly to higher student achievement. In 2015, IBM pioneered a training, certification and job placement program to help military veterans repurpose their expertise and enter the civilian workforce. And our program that facilitates access to large companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supply chain spending by small businesses helps them grow and create new jobs.",
  "Shaping the future of American education At its highest point since World War II, youth unemployment in the United States is at crisis levels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with conditions particularly dire for children of color from low-income families. Among 24-year-olds from low-income backgrounds, fewer than one in 10 hold a college degree.",
  "College completion rates across the board are dismally low, despite huge amounts of student, family and taxpayer money spent on remediation. At the same time, an increasing number of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better jobs require at least a two-year postsecondary degree and work readiness skills. In a tragic disconnect, middle-class jobs requiring postsecondary preparation are on the rise as college completion rates, and the number of job candidates with workplace-ready skills, remain far too low. (See Harvard University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pathways to Prosperity study for more on the skills gap.) To address this challenge head-on, IBM created and opened the first P-TECH school in 2011 in Brooklyn, New York. The vision was to graduate young people from an integrated grades 9 to 14 program within six years, with both their high school diploma and Associate in Applied Science degree \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ready to meet the challenges of college and career.",
  "In June 2015, P-TECH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first six graduates finished their \u00e2\u0080\u009csix-year\u00e2\u0080\u009d program two full years ahead of schedule. By June 2016, more than three dozen P-TECH students had finished their degrees either one or two years ahead of schedule.",
  "Watch the video \u00e2\u0080\u009c The world is becoming increasingly competitive for jobs, and allowing our kids to have a little bit of a head start while they are still in high school to be able to come out with an associate degree\u00e2\u0080\u00a6is a tremendous advantage. \u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Hickenlooper, Governor of Colorado All of P-TECH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graduates were offered positions with IBM. Kiambu Gall, Gabriel Rosa and Radcliffe Sadler joined the company in entry-level professional jobs, while Cletus Andoh, Rahat Mahmud and Michelle Nguyen matriculated at four-year colleges and universities. In December 2015, five more students graduated from P-TECH early. Three are working at IBM while completing their four-year degrees, and two will be attending a four-year college or university on scholarship. The innovative P-TECH program was designed to work in any community.",
  "Since 2011, P-TECH has grown to 40 schools across three U.S. states, plus two schools in Australia. IBM is partnering directly with four of these schools, and more than 100 other businesses are replicating the IBM P-TECH model in schools focused on preparing graduates for careers in advanced manufacturing, healthcare and IT.",
  "A total of 60 schools across six U.S. states will be open by September 2016. Each school is a tri-sector partnership among a school district, a higher-education institution and a participating company that helps direct the school\u00e2\u0080\u0099s curriculum to prepare graduates for where the jobs will be. These companies also provide paid internships and one-on-one mentoring for each student. Each school is open admissions (no testing), and most serve young people from historically underrepresented and underprivileged groups. P-TECH is changing the odds for the next generation. By fall 2016, the P-TECH model will have expanded to 60 schools in six U.S. states and Australia.",
  "Here are some of the reasons why: Out of P-TECH\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first two cohorts of approximately 100 students each, 26 percent of Cohort 1 will have graduated by this June \u00e2\u0080\u0094 earning both their high school and college degrees anywhere from one to two years ahead of schedule. Meanwhile, 11 percent of Cohort 2 will complete their \u00e2\u0080\u009csix-year\u00e2\u0080\u009d program in only four years.",
  "P-TECH Cohort 1 is on track to exceed a 60 percent community college degree completion rate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a degree completion rate that is 50 percent above the U.S. national average. P-TECH students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grades far exceed expectations. High-school students from the inaugural school in Brooklyn, New York, earned grades of A, B or C in 86 percent of their fall 2015 college courses. They received failing grades in only 3 percent of their college courses. Helping teachers teach and students learn The first letter of \u00e2\u0080\u009cSTEM\u00e2\u0080\u009d stands for \u00e2\u0080\u009cscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet far too few teachers are prepared to teach it effectively \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly in the earlier grades. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why IBM created Teachers TryScience, a global resource for science lessons and support for front-line educators.",
  "The Teachers TryScience website offers 589 lessons in 15 languages (including 116 new lessons in four new languages added in 2015 alone), along with 69 pedagogical videos and tutorials. IBM developed each resource in collaboration with master science teachers The program made an especially strong impact in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa in 2015.",
  "In Vietnam, the website proved so effective that the S\u00c3\u00b3c S\u00c6\u00a1n district in Hanoi integrated Teachers TryScience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lessons and active learning methodologies into the official secondary school curriculum. And in Kenya, IBM established a partnership with the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in Africa (CEMASTEA) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Ministry of Education\u00e2\u0080\u0099s professional development agency for STEM teachers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to train 100 education leaders from urban, rural and arid regions how to integrate Teachers TryScience into their classrooms. This effort helped engage nearly 15,000 students throughout 2015. In 2016, CEMASTEA and IBM plan to train 200 educators in 10 counties \u00e2\u0080\u0094 part of a three-year rollout of Teachers TryScience in Kenya. IBM Watson\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 cognitive computing already is helping to accelerate progress in medicine and healthcare. Watson has the ability to synthesize massive amounts of data in service of human decision making, and to collaborate with experts using natural language \u00e2\u0080\u0094 providing assistance when it is most needed at the point of patient contact.",
  "This ability sets Watson apart as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most powerful realization of artificial intelligence. But doctors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones who need help making the best decisions based on the best quality of information.",
  "Teachers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who connect our children with the worlds of opportunity and imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 too often lack the needed support to help them hone their skills and deliver high-quality instruction to their students. Teachers need Watson, too! Teacher Advisor, Powered by IBM Watson was created by teachers, for teachers. Now in development, it will serve as a virtual mentor to educators. Teacher Advisor will help teachers enhance their content knowledge, strengthen their lesson-planning skills and improve their overall instructional practice. Best of all, it will be available whenever a teacher needs it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 discreetly, confidentially and totally free.",
  "Teacher Advisor will launch as a pilot in August 2016, and will be available to all teachers during the 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 17 school year. Using technology to spread knowledge and skills Teachers TryScience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Added 116 new STEM lessons in four new languages in 2015 Teacher Advisor, Powered by IBM Watson \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Confidential, no-cost, virtual teacher mentor debuts in August 2016 Academic initiatives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Providing Watson Analytics\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 and IBM Bluemix\u00c2\u00ae free of charge to more than 6,500 universities worldwide Watch the video Building the pipeline Launched in 2010 to help link postsecondary education more closely to the skills needed in the workplace, the IBM University Relations Future Skills Project engages first-year university students in a cooperative, Problem-Based Learning (PBL) curriculum.",
  "IBM in Japan is among the nearly 60 companies and 20 major universities that participate in the program. In 2015, an IBM volunteer conducted a series of workshops to introduce undergraduates at Yokohama National University to IBM Watson cognitive computing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thereby helping prepare the next generation to develop new business ideas incorporating leading-edge technologies. IBM University Relations $13m $13m Awards and engagement programs in more than 20 countries 133k 133k IBM Bluemix development platform codes issued to faculty and students 30k+ 30k+ Emerging innovators engaged by IBM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developer skills program Learning to innovate In August 2015, the IBM China Software Development Lab, Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Transportation and Logistics Management, National Chiao Tung University, and transport engineering experts THI Consultants joined forces to compete in the first Electronic Toll Collection Innovation Contest sponsored by the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau. The goal was to encourage and support solutions to freeway congestion. The team of IBM and its government, university and industry partners won the top award for an innovative solution incorporating gamification, streaming analytics and user experience design \u00e2\u0080\u0094 using IBM Watson analytics and cognitive capabilities. IBM also initiated an IBM Bluemix development platform curriculum at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.",
  "IBM Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief technology officer and 12 software engineers from the China Development Lab ran the program, through which students gained hands-on opportunities to create web applications, mobile apps and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions using Bluemix. A second program united IBM in Taiwan with National Cheng-Chi University to teach Bluemix development for mobile applications."
