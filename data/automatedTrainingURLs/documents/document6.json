  "Non-profit leaders in South Central Nebraska are tired of a transactional attitude towards public assistance. The United Way and Community Impact Network launched the new Bridging Forward program on Thursday and are billing it as a transformational approach to fighting poverty. What’s later? What’s next? What’s going to be more in the future that we can be looking at that’s going to transform your situation and not just put a quick fix on it, Collaborative Coordinator Brady Rhodes said. Bridging Forward aims to reduce poverty by 30 percent by 2030 in a four-county area around Hastings."
