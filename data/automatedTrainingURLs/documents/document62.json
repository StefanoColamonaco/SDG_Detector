We meet regularly with our shareholders, including both large and small investors, to discuss business strategy, performance, compensation philosophy, corporate governance, and environmental and social topics. In a typical year, we will engage with dozens of shareholders, including our largest shareholders, two to three times per year. This outreach is complementary to the hundreds of touchpoints our Investor Relations team has with shareholders each year. ",
  "We find it beneficial to have ongoing dialogue with our shareholders throughout the year on a full range of investor priorities (instead of engaging with shareholders only prior to our annual meeting on issues to be voted on in the proxy statement). Depending on the circumstance, our lead director or another independent director may engage in these conversations with shareholders as well.In 2020, as part of our corporate governance engagement, we met with corporate governance representatives at shareholders owning over 35% of our stock (excluding the approximately 14% voted by our founder and Executive Chair) and responded to numerous letters from our investors.
