  "Quality of Research The approach dictated by the Quality Assurance Committee consists in introducing quality principles in the department: transparency, information sharing, and verifying results with indicators or documentary evidence. It facilitates self-evaluation, offering support to the Departments in defining improvement goals according to their own specificities and in line with the goals of the University Strategic Plan. Single Annual Report on Departmental Research (SUA-RD) The Single Annual Report of Departmental Research (Scheda Annuale della Ricerca Dipartimentale, SUA-RD) collects information on research and the third mission and is drawn up by the department. During the annual review meeting, the Department analyses qualitative and quantitative information relating to goals, organisation, quality policies of the department, research groups, and third mission and public engagement initiatives. The SUA-RD is also used for the annual verification of research results for the purposes of periodic evaluation and accreditation conducted by ANVUR - Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes.
