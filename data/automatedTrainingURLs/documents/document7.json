By Muhammad Usama Zain posted Mon December 20, 2021 02:11 PM 0 Like Poverty is not an issue which is just limited to a specific area, city or a country rather its a global issue which people across the global are facing. 1 IN 8 people worldwide live in poverty source (source : https://www.2030vision.com/global-goals/no-poverty) Poverty is caused by the unequal distribution of facilities, lack of resources and basic necessities of life among the people which eventually forms a line of differentiation and due to this the rich one\u2019s are becoming more richer and the poor people are becoming more poor and thus many of them are even below the poverty line \u2013 the minimum which a person needs to live. It\u2019s one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is on the number 1 position.",
  "The reason I think that it should be on our top priority is that it\u2019s due to the lack of one of the basic neccesity that is food, which is needed by a living thing to survive. As long as poverty exists in any area, country and nation, the people there cannot grow and even think of any thing as everyday when they will wake up, they will have the worry that how they will get the food today and this cycle will repeat after times and times.",
  "The way technology can help in reducing poverty is that we can use technology to connect the people with the resources on the right time resulting in reducing the communication and information gap. For example the food which goes wasted in different restaurants in a city can be channelize and delivery to the poor people on the right time by using a smart android app so that instead of the food going to a Dustbin, it goes into someone\u2019s stomach and erase the hunger of a poor and needy people. In this way not only we can manage the food waste but also can reduce hunger which will also help us eventually in reducing poverty. Furthermore by using technology in the right we can produce the products having low cost but provides more benefits and can be used for long and this will also help us in making the environment clean and green. Another SDG of United Nations which is on number four is quality education. Everyone should get equal opportunities for quality education despite of their color, race, creed or country.",
  "Education is very important as with it comes knowledge and with that comes the ability to differentiate between right and wrong, good and evil etc. Quality education can be provided by using technology like creating state of the art Educational complexes and centres in different areas especially the low and backward areas so that the youth can get quality education free of cost.",
  "All they need is a willingness and passion to get education, which will eventually attract them to these educational complexes and centres that are providing them the opportunities to get quality education free of cost from any part of the world through online forums. In this way they will have equal opportunities to learn from top notch experts of the fields which will not only teach them academically but also technical skills at the same time. In this way the youth will get the chance to improve themselves and contribute in their communities.
