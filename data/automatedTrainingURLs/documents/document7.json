The Global Development Lab\u2019s mission is to help end the extreme poverty that affects 1.2 billion people on the planet living on just $1.25 a day\u00a0by 2030. ",
  "The lab will support breakthrough solutions in water, health, food security, nutrition, energy, education and climate change, reaching 200 million people in the next five years. As Bill Gates challenged world leaders\u00a0in his \u201ccreative capitalism\u201d mandate at the 2008 World Economic Forum, Microsoft has both a moral responsibility and a business imperative to take a leadership role eradicating poverty. The business imperative? Citing Africa as an example, 50 percent of that continent\u2019s 1 billion people are under the age of 20. Its middle class is exploding. And they are buying mobile devices. ",
  "McKinsey recently reported\u00a0that by 2025, Africa will be home to 600 million Internet users \u2013 many of whom will be children \u2013 contributing $300 billion to the continent\u2019s gross domestic product. To put that into perspective, it\u2019s double the total addressable market in the U.S.\nMicrosoft is currently investing in this agenda in a number of ways. ",
  "Our current research and development budget is more than $9.5 billion and is focused on both inventing new technologies and finding innovative ways of using existing technologies to reach underserved communities. Microsoft in Education has committed more than $750 million worldwide to help drive education transformation around the world, and we provide significant discounts on our software for schools. Our YouthSpark initiative will reach 300 million young people under the age of 25 before the end of 2015, and our 4Afrika\u00a0program is designed to connect several countries on the African continent to the Internet, while simultaneously training more than 200,000 developers and seeding the market with over one million devices. To build on these investments, we\u2019ll look to partner with USAID across the following areas:\nDiscover, test and transition to scale breakthrough development innovations: Microsoft brings diverse expertise and resources to co-design, test and evaluate new products, technologies and programs in emerging markets. Tangible examples include TV White Spaces \u2013 bringing low-cost or no-cost broadband to schools \u2013 as well as Matuto: Literacy 4 Life\u2013 driving literacy for millions of children via free e-books coupled with affordable devices for teachers, parents and students. Data and research: It\u2019s critical that technology engagements in education have measurable results for both innovative teaching practices and student learning outcomes. ",
  "We will leverage several existing projects to contribute to this collaboration, including the Innovative Teaching and Learning Research, Partners in Learning School Research Tool and M&E products developed in collaboration with the British Council for Project Badiliko, which has trained 18,000 teachers and reached more than 100,000 learners in a \u201chub and spoke\u201d model. Scale proven solutions that transform development aid: Microsoft is committed to ensuring that the right solutions can be scaled, as evidenced by our work to develop new distribution networks and to commercialize and fund new ventures, particularly in Africa. ",
  "It is with great hope and enthusiasm that we look forward to our partnership with USAID\u2019s Global Development Lab. We know the power of science and technology, combined with greater connectivity and partnerships, can deliver results better, cheaper, faster and more sustainably than traditional approaches. And we also know that these efforts will spark a new generation of passionate Microsoft customers and partners.
