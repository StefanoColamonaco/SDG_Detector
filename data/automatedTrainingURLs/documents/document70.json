CEO Tim Cook was unusually outspoken on social issues in an interview aired by CBS Sunday, a day before the launch of the company\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

On Sunday, however, Cook broke from his carefully prepared script and strongly pushed social issues, the latest corporate chieftain to weigh in, amid intensifying discussions about inequality in the U.S. and representation of Black Americans in technology-related enterprises. \u201cI do believe, optimistically, this is one of those moments that we could make significant progress,\u201d Cook said of a groundswell of calls for social justice in the wake of the killing of George Floyd while in police custody on May 25. \u201cFor so many things, it seems like there\u2019s such slow progress, and then all of the sudden, there\u2019s a giant leap.\u201d Ostensibly, Cook appeared on CBS Sunday Morning to promote the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, which will take place virtually for the first time on Monday. ",
  "But the 8-minute interview quickly turned into a discourse on racial inequity, rights for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer community, and challenges managing a $1.5 trillion tech behemoth in the age of COVID-19. Perhaps his most telling comments came when discussing the iPhone and its role in filming the murder of Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white. ",
  "Chauvin driving his knee into the neck of an unarmed Floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds until he perished, was captured on video and has helped to ignite a modern civil rights movement. \u201cSome of the most dramatic societal changes have occurred because someone captured video,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe thing that has changed though, and we\u2019re very proud of this, is that we put a camera in everybody\u2019s pocket, and so it becomes much tougher as a society, I believe, to convince themselves that it didn\u2019t happen, or that it happened in a different manner or whatever it might be.\u201d The Alabama native shared his first encounter with racism, which he remembered \u201cas if it were yesterday.\u201d It was seeing doors marked \u201cwhites only,\u201d and failing to understand \u201chow people could convince themselves that this was right.\u201d Cook, who is gay, later lauded the Supreme Court\u2019s decision against job discrimination toward people based on gender or orientation. He said he is \u201cincredibly grateful for their opinion.\u201d Amid the social protests, there is a raging pandemic and economic recession that has put the safety of Apple\u2019s \n        AAPL,\n        +0.37%\n      \u00a0137,000 employees squarely on his shoulders. The company is in the process of slowly onboarding workers at its vast Apple Park campus in Cupertino, Calif., after it temporarily closed some Apple Stores in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Arizona because of COVID-19 spikes. \u201cThe thing that I worry that we\u2019ll be missing is the serendipity that we all count on,\u201d Cook said of the disconnect between a small number of employees returning to offices working with a vast majority working from home. ",
  "\u201cAnd for that reason I can\u2019t wait until we\u2019re all back together.\u201d \u201cAs a general rule, very few people that thrive on uncertainty,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBut the most important thing for us is, we viewed it as a challenge to overcome.\u201d True to Apple form, Cook was evasive on what to expect from Monday\u2019s keynote speech opening WWDC. ",
  "\u201cI\u2019m full of secrets and it\u2019s hard not to overflow right now,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been trained well.\u201d This hasn\u2019t stopped the rumor mill from speculating on what to expect at WWDC.
