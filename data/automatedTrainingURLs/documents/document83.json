",
  "In 2020, we became the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, reaching 65% renewable energy across our business. Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuildings\nAmazon operates hundreds of world-class facilities in cities across the globe that serve our customers and support our local communities. We are designing buildings that help lead the industry toward net-zero carbon, while improving the resource efficiency of our facilities and prioritizing the health and wellness of our building occupants. Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World\u2019s First Net-Zero Carbon Arena\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Amazon secured the naming rights to Climate Pledge Arena, slated to become the first net-zero carbon certified arena in the world. The arena will feature all-electric operations systems powered by 100% renewable electricity from on-site solar panels and off-site renewable energy projects. Events at the arena will be made fully net-zero carbon by investing in forestry projects that sequester any remaining carbon emissions from the arena\u2019s operations through nature-based solutions. ",
  "Additional commitments include eliminating single-use plastics, conserving water, and producing zero waste from the arena\u2019s operations. Arlington Headquarters\n\n\n\nPlans for our second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia feature a range of carbon reduction solutions and energy efficiency enhancements, including highly efficient building systems, high-efficiency lighting with advanced controls, and a high-performing building envelope that facilitates climate control. ",
  "All-electric central heating and cooling systems will eliminate on-site combustion for heating and domestic hot water, and a nearby solar farm will power the campus with 100% renewable energy. The buildings will incorporate locally sourced materials, to reduce the carbon impact of material transportation, and low-carbon materials, including low-carbon concrete supplemented with Carbon Cure technology, a Climate Pledge Fund investment. Corporate Offices\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s global corporate offices are located in vibrant communities and urban hubs. Many of our corporate buildings offer plazas and open green spaces for communal and public use. Even more feature green roofs and other green infrastructure that provide outdoor amenity space while supporting ecological functions like green stormwater management. The interiors integrate biophilic design concepts, such as green walls and locally sourced woods, along with energy-efficient lighting, composting and recycling, and amenity spaces for employee wellness. ",
  "Many of our buildings also offer plug-in electric vehicle charging stations, bike parking, and showers to encourage low-carbon transportation for employees and visitors. Operations Facilities\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s operations facilities include a variety of building types and sizes where we process orders for our customers. ",
  "To minimize energy use, these facilities feature state-of-the-art technology and are designed with efficient building systems. Many of our operations facilities throughout the U.S., Europe, and India are powered by on-site solar, where a rooftop installation can power up to 80% of a facility\u2019s energy use. As of June 2021, we have more than 90 rooftop solar installations on operations facilities around the world and we continue to scale this program globally. Amazon Physical Stores\n\n\n\nAmazon Physical Stores provide a range of retail and grocery shopping experiences for our customers. Our physical stores use highly efficient LED lighting, with energy-reducing lighting controls, and incorporate natural daylighting techniques, such as skylights and large windows. We also utilize energy-efficient heating and cooling systems to reduce energy consumption. ",
  "Across our grocery channels, we are replacing conventional refrigerants with natural alternatives that have a lower ozone depletion and global warming potential. In many of our new physical stores, we are increasing our use of doored cases for refrigerated products, enhancing energy efficiency and maintaining product quality for longer durations. ",
  "Data Centers\n\n\n\nAWS is continuously working to increase the efficiency of our facilities, and our scale allows us to achieve higher resource utilization and efficiency than typical on-premises data centers. When possible, we incorporate direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, reducing energy and water consumption. During cooler months, outside air is directly supplied to the data center without using any water. During the hottest months of the year, outside air is cooled through an evaporative process using water before being pushed into the server rooms, and we have optimized our cooling systems to minimize water usage. AWS has also demonstrated our commitment to water stewardship by using reclaimed or recycled water instead of potable water in multiple regions, and we are working with local utilities to expand the use of reclaimed water. Shipment Zero\n\n\n\n\n                        Shipment Zero is our goal to deliver 50% of Amazon shipments with net-zero carbon by 2030. ",
  "This means that the fulfillment operations we undertake to deliver customer shipments are net-zero carbon\u2014from the fulfillment center where an item is picked off the shelf, to the materials used to package the item, and the mode of transportation that gets the package to the customer\u2019s door.
