  "The Climate Pledge \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Founding The Climate Pledge\nScientists tell us that we have a limited window to make unprecedented headway in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. No one company or organization can do this on its own and everyone must do their part\u2014business does not operate in a vacuum. To drive collective, cross-sector action on the climate crisis, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge with Global Optimism in 2019 on the conviction that global businesses are responsible, accountable, and able to act on the climate crisis. Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPledge Commitments\nSignatories of The Climate Pledge agree to three principal areas of action:\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Reporting\nMeasure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis. Carbon Elimination\nImplement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies. Credible Offsets\nNeutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040. ",
  "Building a Better World\n                \n            \nJoining The Climate Pledge is an opportunity for companies to be part of a community of leading businesses committed to transformational action to protect the global economy from the disruptive risks associated with climate change. The Climate Pledge by the Numbers\nSignatories of the Pledge form a cross-sector community of companies, organizations, and partners working together to address the climate crisis and solve the challenges of decarbonizing our economy.
