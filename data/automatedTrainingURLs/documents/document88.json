No problem. 2.5 Million Served $86M Project Value 315 MGD Tracy, California Close Providing drinking water to over 2.5 million people in the Metropolitan San Francisco area facebook twitter linkedin email Water treatment plants are some of the most expensive and complicated capital projects undertaken by public agencies. When the plant supplies drinking water to more than 2.5 million people, the stakes are even higher. Stantec exceeded difficult design requirements and helped the owner save significant public funds while delivering the project ahead of schedule. At 315 million gallons per day, the facility is one of the largest UV disinfection drinking water plants in North America and the largest in California.",
  "A facility of this size normally takes up to four years to complete \u2013 working in partnership with the contractor on a design-build team, we completed the project in two years and three months. The facility meets California Title 24, the strictest energy code in the country.",
  "The operations, UV process area, and electrical building were combined into a single LEED Silver certified facility, reducing capital costs and improving operability and maintenance. The plant is designed to be robust and low maintenance, while satisfying seismic design criteria that are necessary for this post disaster structure.
