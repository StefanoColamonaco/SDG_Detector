goals and investing in zero- and low-carbon technologies. The Climate Pledge is a commitment co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism to be net-zero carbon by 2040\u201410 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. ",
  "The Pledge now has more than 100 signatories, representing companies with over $1.4 trillion in global annual revenues and more than 5 million employees across 25 industries in 16 countries.As part of our work to build awareness of the urgent need for climate action and share ideas on how companies can act, Amazon created \"Challenge Accepted\", a marketing campaign launched in July across Europe, which shows the impact of climate change on the planet and how signatories of The Climate Pledge are already working to limit their carbon emissions.The ads feature young people from around the world challenging businesses to mitigate their impact on the climate crisis, and introduces Climate Pledge signatories, the likes of Heineken, Telefonica, Unilever, Visa and more, as accepting the challenge. The Climate Pledge: Challenge Accepted Launch :60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040. Signatories play an important role in sending a signal to inventors that there is rapidly growing demand for green technologies, products, and services that help reduce carbon emissions.Signatories to The Climate Pledge agree to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis, and implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations. Signatories also commit to neutralizing any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040\u2014a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of 2050.Learn more at theclimatepledge.com/challengeaccepted.
