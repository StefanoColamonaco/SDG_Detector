  "More women in the workplace would reduce poverty, according to ESRI. Increasing female labour force participation and spending more on benefits targeting children would decrease poverty, according to a study by the ESRI. The research shows that between 2004-2019, lone parents and their children and working-age adults with disabilities and their children, experienced the highest rates of at risk-of-poverty deprivation and consistent poverty. The study, commissioned by the Department of Social Protection found that these groups also had the highest degree of overlap between income poverty and deprivation. The ESRI used data from the Irish Survey on Income and Living Conditions for 2019 which is conducted annually by the Central Statistics Office. The ESRI has estimated an overall at risk poverty rate of 14% for 2022 but says that by increasing female labour force participation and hours worked to match those of men, this could be reduced to 11.1%."
