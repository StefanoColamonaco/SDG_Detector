This is the year in which the World Economic Forum estimates there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Although initially created to premiere at Tribeca and run on YouTube as a skippable pre-roll, the film made it all the way to the UN General Assembly, where it was presented to hundreds of world leaders.
