  "If you are curious to learn more, or to understand how to take full advantage of this opportunity, we advise you not to miss it! Liquid prep, a hint from 2019 CallForCode Challenge The Call for Code 2019 Global Challenge asked teams of developers, designers, data scientists and business analysts to build solutions that significantly improve preparedness for natural disasters and accelerate relief when they hit.",
  "Liquid Prep offers an end-to-end solution for farmers who want to optimize their water usage; especially during times of drought. It is specially designed for low-literate farmers in developing countries who also need access to advanced agricultural advice to be successful. By using an intuitive mobile app, local soil sensors, and backend service in IBM cloud, farmers can be better informed on how to use limited water supplies and increase their chances of growing healthy crops for their small plots of land. Going deep into the problem: Clean Water According to the World Health Organization, 2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed drinking water services, 4.2 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services, and 3 billion people lack basic handwashing facilities. These services are critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. Even in areas that have these services, there are vast inequalities in the accessibility, availability, and quality of the services.",
  "UNICEF is urgently appealing for funding and support to reach more children with basic water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, especially those children who are cut off from safe water because they live in remote areas, in places where water is untreated or polluted, or because they are without a home, living in a slum or on the street. From intelligent solutions for small farmers to recycling showers, technology can make a significant impact on the availability of water and its consumption.",
  "IBM provides various technologies such as IoT, Watson AI services, and blockchain. IBM Water Management as a Service platform can monitor water resources in real time. Through this cloud-based platform, IBM is helping to improve the management of water resources.
