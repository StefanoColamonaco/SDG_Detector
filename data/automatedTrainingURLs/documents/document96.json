  "Also, 1 in 10 species known to man is found in the Amazon Rain forest(the biggest Rain-Forest). That's about 10% of animals known to mankind. But what is the point of the goal and why should we care? Find out below.The point of life on land is to protect and preserve forests and other ecosystems. Also to reduce deforestation. If this problem doesn\u2019t get solved there will not be any trees for animals to live in and hide. ",
  "If we don't stop deforestation we won't have any trees, and we need trees for everyday life. Vegetation gives us air and if we cut all the trees down we won't have any air to breath and the air wouldn't be as good as it used to (global warming).This is a major problem we are struggling with. ",
  "But we can't let deforestation get the best of us. It\u2019s easy to help. You could do it off your sofa. Well, for starters we could tell the one person who pays bills to try to pay online and try to reduce the amount of paper they use. Also, most of us have social media sites, we can share a picture or a post on how to help. Therefore, we waste lots of paper on stuff we don't need, for instance sometimes for school we print our notes but we can study it on the computer instead of killing trees. ",

  "A few years ago, Ghana was full of trees and now, only about 10% of the trees still stand. Indonesia was covered in trees. ",
  "Now 29% of the trees have been cut down. The islands that we know as the Philippines, used to be full of vegetation. Now, only about 35% of the trees are left. Honduras is struggling because a \u00a0few years ago the forest in this land was lush and plentiful. Today about half of it is gone.Therefore, those are just some of the many reasons why deforestation is a big issue. We need to solve this problem. ",
