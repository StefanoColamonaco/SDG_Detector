Join us each month through the end of 2021 as we discover how technology can be used to achieve the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).Combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and halting biodiversity loss are all pressing challenges for us here in the Sonoran Desert. The City of Tucson and Pima County both have initiatives underway to address these issues.Join us as we look into the data and the initiatives underway - hopefully you'll be inspired to take action yourself!
