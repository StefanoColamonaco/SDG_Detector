  "Follow In Culture\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re facing unprecedented challenges from climate change: pollution, flooding, drought, loss of biodiversity, and a rapidly growing population of almost eight billion people. Lives, livelihoods, and natural resources hang in the balance. But there\u2019s still hope to reverse the damaging cycles we\u2019ve created. Together, we can work to ensure a safer, healthier, and more sustainable future for our planet. Restoring Earth\u2019s ecosystems\nOur planet\u2019s ecosystems are a vital source of biodiversity. How can technology play a role in helping us conserve these valuable resources? ",
  "Microsoft is taking on that challenge by partnering with organizations like SilviaTerra, The Nature Conservancy, and many others as part of our AI for Earth Initiative. And all of this work is building towards the creation of a Planetary Computer that connects trillions of data points about our environment with the power of machine learning\u2014empowering experts with actionable insights.

  "Telling our tree stories\t\t\t\t\t\nThis Earth Day, we share the stories of people who\u2019ve devoted their professional lives to eco-advocacy. And they share with us why our forests are more important than ever and what we can do\u2014even from our homes\u2014to ensure they\u2019re protected for years to come. Celebrate Earth Day at home with these tree stories\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forest is talking to us\nIn every forest stands a carefully balanced ecosystem of trees that\u2019s critical to sustaining life, from filtering our water supply to absorbing carbon emissions to serving as a habitat for wildlife. But fires, pests, drought, and deforestation are threatening this delicate equilibrium. That\u2019s why SilviaTerra created the most detailed United States forest map ever. Using satellite imagery and AI, it allows us to see\u2014at 100x the resolution\u2014what we couldn\u2019t see before. ",
  "This helps researchers and foresters pinpoint urgent environmental problems, and then tap into what nature is telling us to find solutions. Get an inside look at six national parks to see how SilviaTerra\u2019s data can help foresters better understand and preserve US forests and their precious, life-giving, air-cleaning, wildlife-protecting trees.
