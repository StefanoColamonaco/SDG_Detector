Dear Earth event, sharing ways Google is working to solve climate change \u2014 and why he\u2019s optimistic we can make meaningful progress. Below is a transcript of his remarks. ",
  "Hello fellow dear earthlings. Thanks for tuning in. I can\u2019t think of another issue that would bring together former President Obama, Pope Francis and BLACKPINK. It\u2019s more proof that climate change is the biggest challenge we face\u2026and it\u2019s one that will affect all of us in deeply personal ways.You know, there was water scarcity when I was growing up and droughts were frequent events. Over time, the water table became really low and many homes didn\u2019t have access to fresh water. We would have to wait for rationed water to be brought in on trucks, and then wait in long lines to carry water back home.There were times when the trucks didn\u2019t come at all \u2014 and it was all just part of normal life.Fast forward to 2015, I woke up to the news that Chennai had a 1-in-100 year flood and saw pictures where the whole city was submerged in water. ",
  "Over two million people were displaced. It really drove home for me, in a personal way, how climate change can impact communities, especially those already facing challenges.A couple of years after that, I woke up to orange skies and smoke from nearby wildfires in California. ",
  "It was another reminder how climate change is impacting so many of our communities.Despite these challenges, I\u2019m still optimistic about our future.That\u2019s because I believe in people. Throughout history, people have made the impossible, possible. We\u2019ve developed life-saving vaccines, expanded opportunity through the internet and landed on the moon.Solving climate change is humanity\u2019s next big moonshot.But unlike the moon landing \u2014 there is a clear deadline for action, and severe consequences if we fail.Yet there\u2019s good news, too: There are more people focused on solving climate change than ever before. From governments and academic researchers, to companies like ours, to people like you.And your generation is rightfully demanding solutions and holding us to account.The other bright spot is technology. A lot can change in ten years. Ten years ago most of Google\u2019s energy consumption was from traditional sources. ",
  "Today, we match 100 percent of our energy with renewable sources.That shows you what is possible in a decade. And now, we\u2019re focused on the next ten years.Rather than tell you what we\u2019re doing \u2014 let me show you. ",
  "This is what it looks like inside one of Google\u2019s data centers.Data centers are what make the internet run. They power the games you stream and the YouTube videos you watch. And they run on about 1% of the world\u2019s electricity, and so changing how that electricity is generated can make a big impact on the other 99%.That\u2019s why we want to run our data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7. So, in the future, every search you do, every YouTube video you watch, every Gmail you send will be powered by clean energy \u2014 sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. And our goal is to do all this by 2030.Right now, I\u2019m standing inside our newest building at our headquarters in California. As you can see, it\u2019s still under construction. ",
  "It will take workspace design and sustainability to a new level. The lumber is all responsibly sourced. ",
  "And when it rains, we collect the water, treat it and keep it in tanks for future use.Maybe my favorite thing about this building is the roof. The outside is covered in solar panels that remind me of a dragon\u2019s scales. And it will generate about 40% of the energy the building uses.Sustainable operations and design can make a big difference. So can people.Our goal is to find new ways that our products can help one billion people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives. Like choosing the most eco-friendly route home. Or finding the nearest bike share.These small changes can add up to a big impact \u2014 and our planet and your future deserve nothing less.There will be moments when it feels like progress isn\u2019t fast enough. ",
  "Or that action isn\u2019t bold enough. So be impatient. ",
  "That\u2019s what will drive progress. It\u2019s the only thing that ever does.If you do that, together, we can make sure our planet\u2019s best days are still ahead.
