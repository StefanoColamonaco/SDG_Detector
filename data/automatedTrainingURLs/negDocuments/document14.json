It alleged gender discrimination, unequal pay, harassment and retaliation.\u201cI am so glad we achieved this first step toward justice for the women of Riot Games,\u201d said Jes Negron, a plaintiff.\u201cI hope this case serves as an example for other studios and an inspiration for women in the industry at large. Women in gaming do not have to suffer inequity and harassment in silence \u2013 change is possible.\u201dActivision Blizzard scandal a \u2018watershed moment\u2019 for women in the gaming industryRead moreGenie Harrison, an employment and sexual harassment lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said: \u201cThis is a great day for the women of Riot Games \u2013 and for women at all video game and tech companies \u2013 who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.\u201dAs part of the settlement, the company agreed to workplace reforms including monitoring by a third party for three years, pay transparency and \u201climiting subjectivity and implicit bias in hiring and selection processes\u201d.Riot Games agreed to settle the suit in 2019 for $10m but the agreement was blocked by the DFEH, which argued in a court filing that victims should be entitled to up to $400m.In a statement on Monday, Riot Games, which is owned by the Chinese internet company Tencent, said: \u201cIn an effort to drive ongoing transparency and accountability, Riot has also committed to having its internal reporting and pay equity processes monitored by a third party jointly approved by Riot and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing for three years.\u201dIn an email to employees seen by the Washington Post, five company executives responded to the settlement.\u201cWe want to acknowledge that the timing of this announcement isn\u2019t ideal,\u201d they reportedly wrote. \u201cThe final details of the agreement came together quickly, and we wanted you to hear about it from us directly rather than read about it in the news while on break.\u201dTopicsGamesDiscrimination at workSexual harassmentGender pay gapGenderCalifornianewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularBooksMusicTV & radioArt & designFilmGamesClassicalStageNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
