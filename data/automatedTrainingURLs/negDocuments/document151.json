For example, the manufacturing value added per capita in LCDs is 45 times lower than in Europe and, in developing countries, only 30% of agricultural production undergoes industrial processing, compared to 98% in high-income countries.",
  "Basic infrastructure \u2013roads, energy grids, water and sanitation infrastructure, and information and communication technologies \u2013 remain scarce in developing countries: approximately 1.2 billion people don\u2019t have access to reliable phone services, 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, and nearly 800 million people lack access to water. These constraints also affect the overall productivity rates of developing countries, especially in Africa. Moreover, unsustainable industrial processes causing high carbon dioxide emissions too often remain the norm in developing countries. Achieving SDG9 is an essential part of our cooperation work. Developing better infrastructure is crucial to eventually improve human well-being and industrial productivity and competitiveness. Through blending, we increasingly invest in infrastructural projects that have a multiplier effect on our partner countries\u2019 sustainable development.",
  "We support our partner countries\u2019 industrial transition towards sustainable processes and technologies, which will allow them to increase their productivity and competitiveness, while respecting the environment. We also act to improve access to financial services and technologies in our partner countries, in line with our ambition to leave no one behind and foster inclusive growth.",
  "Our policy approach to sustainable development is broad and inclusive. Our work on SDG9 is closely linked to other SDGs and includes credit and research for technological advances, developing value chains, and promoting good business practices. Our programmes have so far focused on physical and mobile connectivity, coupled with policy and sector reform, to ensure cost-effective investments that yield returns. Together with EU countries, one of our priorities is to support the extension of broadband connectivity and digital infrastructure, especially in rural areas, and to promote digital literacy, skills, and entrepreneurship, including among women and young people.
