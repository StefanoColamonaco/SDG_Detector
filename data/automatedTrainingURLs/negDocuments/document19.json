Join the Fight for CEJA! ",
  "Saying Illinois faces an economic and public health crisis, a racial and economic justice crisis, and a crisis of utility corruption, supporters of CEJA plan to file the bill in the Illinois House of Representatives this week. The bill was first introduced in 2019 and has wide support, but has faced delays caused by the pandemic. New leadership in Washington signals a renewed push for cleaner energy, but advocates say only states can ensure that utilities are held accountable and that the benefits of clean, affordable energy actually get delivered to residents. \u201cThe Legislature should enact the long-delayed Clean Energy Jobs Act, which would expand renewable energy, boost energy conservation, put more electric vehicles on the roads, provide support for displaced fossil fuel workers and their communities and steer jobs to economically challenged communities,\u201d the Chicago Sun-Times wrote in a recent editorial. CEJA\u2019s lead co-sponsors are state Rep. Ann Williams, chair of the House Energy Committee, and state Sen. Cristina Castro. Both wrote in a recent opinion piece in the Chicago Tribune that CEJA helps communities most in need, has strong support and puts people and policy before utility company profits\u2014a key reform in the wake of ComEd\u2019s corruption scandal. ",
  "\u201cThe time to pass CEJA is now,\u201d they wrote. CUB outlined the top reasons it supports the Clean Energy Jobs Act. ",
  "It\u2019s good for our utility bills. CEJA would:\n\n\nExpand natural gas efficiency programs, producing an estimated $700 million per year in consumer savings. Implement electricity market reforms to protect ComEd customers from up to $1.7 billion in higher electric bills due to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruling in 2019 to bail out polluting power plants. While new leadership at FERC promises changes, that will take time and Illinois need to act now to avoid higher costs. Secure savings. CEJA\u2019s \u201cconsumer protection adjustment\u201d guarantees cost savings for ComEd customers over what they currently pay for electricity. ",
  "End formula rate hikes. Setting ComEd and Ameren rates by formula\u2014a system that lacks adequate consumer protections\u2014would be replaced with a system in which state regulators only approve utility programs and rates that are cost-effective. ",
  "It holds utilities accountable. CEJA would:\n\n\nCreate an independent monitor to ensure ethics compliance by all public utilities. Provide restitution for customers. In the wake of the ethics scandal, ComEd shareholders would have to repurpose ill-gained profits so they instead go to programs that serve communities in need. (CUB also is suing ComEd in federal court to win fair compensation for customers. See the Chicago Sun-Times story and read CUB\u2019s complaint.) ",
  "Prohibit the use of customer funds to cover expenses tied to federal ethics investigations. It cares about communities amid the pandemic. ",
  "CEJA would:\n\n\nCreate thousands of clean energy jobs. Direct jobs and job training to communities that need it the most, including communities of color and towns where big polluters have shuttered their coal-fired power plants and abandoned workers. Give new funding to solar companies that are close to shutting down because of shortcomings in current policy. \u201cCEJA is the only energy bill in Springfield that will help create clean energy jobs so Illinois can recover from the pandemic, and it will push Illinois toward 100 percent clean energy by 2050, without raising electric bills, hiking taxes or giving bailouts to big energy companies,\u201d CUB Executive Director David Kolata said. Please join the fight for CEJA. Send a message to Springfield. "
