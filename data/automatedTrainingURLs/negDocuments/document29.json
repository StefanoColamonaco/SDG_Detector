  "Sustainable cities and communities\nMore than half of the world\u2019s population now live in urban areas. By 2050, that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people \u2013 two-thirds of all humanity. Extreme poverty is often concentrated in urban spaces, and national and city governments struggle to accommodate the rising population in these areas. Making cities safe and sustainable means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, and upgrading slum settlements. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces.
