"The slower projected future growth of grain consumption in the developing countries stems from expectations of both lower production growth rates and lower growth in grain imports. In the period to 1990 production growth rates are expected to fall from levels achieved in the 1960s and 1970s because many countries have already adopted the high-yielding wheat and rice varieties developed in the 1960s and further production gains from this source are becoming more difficult. Slower import growth is projected because of the severe impact on per capita income levels of the result recession and the debt-repayment burden which many of the developing countries bear."
