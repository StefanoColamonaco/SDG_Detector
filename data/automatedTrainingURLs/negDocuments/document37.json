Sustainable Development Goals Explained: Life Below Water\nA global approach to the management of marine litter pollution represents an important step towards a resolution, as it is a problem that goes beyond the territorial boundaries of individual nations. ",
  "The Mediterranean Sea is an almost closed basin where currents return 80% of plastic waste to the coasts, meaning that, for every kilometer of coastline, more than 5 kg of plastic accumulates per day. Nevertheless, the worst type of pollution arising from plastic is the invisible one: microplastics. The Mediterranean Sea has only 1% of the world\u2019s waters, but it contains 7% of marine microplastics. Lines, fishing nets, bags, bottles, flasks, and much more: large pieces of plastic injure, strangle and often cause the death of animals such as sea turtles and seabirds. There are 134 species of fish, birds, turtles and marine mammals that are victims of plastic ingestion in the Mediterranean.
