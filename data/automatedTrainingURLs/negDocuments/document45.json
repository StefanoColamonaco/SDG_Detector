A successful development agenda requires inclusive partnerships \u2014 at the global, regional, national and local levels \u2014 built upon principles and values, and upon a shared vision and shared goals placing people and the planet at the centre.

  "Many countries require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade. Yet, aid levels are falling and donor countries have not lived up to their pledge to ramp up development finance. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply, by 3 per cent, in 2020, experiencing its worst recession since the Great Depression. Strong international cooperation is needed now more than ever to ensure that countries have the means to recover from the pandemic, build back better and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. COVID-19\u00a0 response\nNo country can overcome this pandemic alone. Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone\u2019s interests. ",
  "The UN Secretary-General issued a series of policy briefs that lay out a vision for how the international community can deliver an effective, coordinated response to COVID-19, ensuring we keep the most vulnerable populations front and centre. The policy briefs bring together analysis from across the UN system and provide Member States with concrete ideas for how to address the consequences and even seize opportunities in the midst of the crisis. ",
  "A high-level event convened by Canada, Jamaica and the United Nations on 28 May brought together governments and international organizations to sharpen and accelerate our global response to the significant economic and human impacts of COVID-19, and advance concrete solutions to the development emergency. Most developing countries do not have sufficient domestic resources and fiscal space to fund adequate COVID-19 response and recovery measures. International cooperation and external finance are crucial. Particularly alarming is the prospect of a new debt crisis, compounded by tumbling prices for oil and other key commodities, heavily impacting Least Developed Countries that were already at high risk of debt distress. The UN is calling for Special Drawing Rights, targeted debt relief and an extension of the debt moratorium to all developing countries. The 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report outlines measures to address the impact of the unfolding global recession and financial turmoil, especially in the world\u2019s poorest countries, based on joint research and analysis by more than 60 UN agencies and international institutions. ",
  "To support efforts in low- and middle-income countries, the UN Secretary-General launched a UN Response and Recovery Trust Fund. In addition, the UN set out a Global Humanitarian Response Plan to assist the most vulnerable populations, including refugees and internally displaced persons. ",
  "And the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Foundation and partners launched a first-of-its-kind Solidarity Response Fund to allow corporations and individuals to directly contribute to WHO\u2019s COVID-19 response. To address issues of open and timely access to critical data needed by governments and all sectors of society to respond to the global COVID-19 crisis, this UN portal provides a space for the global statistical community to share guidance, actions, tools and best practices to ensure the operational continuity of data programmes by National Statistical Offices. To combat the growing scourge of COVID-19 misinformation, the UN launched Verified, an initiative to increase the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information on three themes: science (to save lives), solidarity (to promote local and global cooperation), and solutions (to advocate for support to impacted populations). Why it matters:\nPartnerships\nInfographic:\nPartnerships\nFacts and figuresGoal 17 targetsLinksFacts and figures\n\nNet Official Development Assistance flows by member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development totaled $147.4 billion in 2019. 79 per cent of imports from developing countries enter developed countries duty-free\nThe debt burden on developing countries remains stable at about 3 per cent of export revenue\nTrade, foreign direct investment and remittances all projected to decline by up to 40\u00a0 per cent in 2020. Almost half of the world\u2019s population is not connected to the internet, particularly in poor countries. ",
