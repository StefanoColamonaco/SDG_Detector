Companies from Netflix to Goldman Sachs sought to make their paid-leave programs more equitable.",
  "The gender wage gap was called out again and again, by workers as varied as Hollywood actresses and Google engineers. Government policies in the U.S. and abroad aimed to increase transparency around pay and require more women in company boardrooms. Gender discrimination was brought to the fore in a series of high-profile lawsuits.These make up just a fraction of the events that transpired. What follows is a look back at some important moments from the past year when men and women moved closer to workplace parity.Ellen Pao takes a break with her legal team. (Stephen Lam / Reuters)In a $16 million lawsuit, Ellen Pao sued her former employer, the venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for gender discrimination. She alleged that the company overlooked her for promotions on the basis of gender and later terminated her when she brought up the issue.",
  "While Pao lost her case in March, it ultimately drew greater scrutiny to the underrepresentation and experiences of women in tech and venture capital. She\u2019s since written more about her careers in law and tech, including a commentary in the newsletter Lenny, in which she continues to call out sexism in Silicon Valley, but is optimistic about change.",
  "She writes: \u201cEventually, there comes a point where you can't just rally and explain away all the behavior as creepy exceptions or pin the blame on yourself \u2026 You see patterns, systemic problems, and it doesn't matter where you are or what industry you pursue.\u201dPatricia Arquette accepts the award for best actress in a supporting role, for Boyhood.

(Mark Lennihan / AP)Erica Baker, a former engineer at Google (now at Slack), created a spreadsheet earlier this year that enabled people to fill out their salaries and share that information more broadly within the company. Nearly 5 percent of workers at Google have since completed the spreadsheet, according to Baker, although she noted that she was penalized for creating it: At Google, employees are able to give each other $150 bonuses as a nod to good work, but, Baker says, seven of the bonuses she received, all of which mentioned the spreadsheet, were denied by her manager.Peggy Young, a former UPS worker whose health care ended when the company denied her request for special accommodations during her pregnancy, with her daughter (Jacquelyn Martin / AP)When she was pregnant, Peggy Young, a former driver at UPS, requested an adjustment to her workload, per her doctor\u2019s recommendations.",
  "The company refused and put her on unpaid leave, citing her inability to lift the 70 pounds required of her in the job description, and she ultimately sued. In March, the Supreme Court decided in Young\u2019s favor on the grounds that UPS, which makes special accommodations for others with specific health conditions, needed to make comparable ones for pregnant women that enable them to continue working.David Cameron arrives at Fort St. Angelo during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.",
  "(Andrew Winning / Reuters)In July, British Prime Minister David Cameron established a rule requiring all companies with 250 or more employees to share information on the average pay that their male and female workers receive. His aim: to \u201ccast sunlight on the discrepancies and create the pressure we need for change, driving women\u2019s wages up.\u201d In a 2014 World Economic Forum report, the U.K. ranked 48th out of 131 countries for gender pay equity, while the U.S. came in 65th.Jim Young / ReutersWhile the headlines covering the topic were lighthearted\u2014a Washington Post piece in July was titled \u201cFreezing women, oblivious men\u201d\u2014a study from Nature published this year found that the formula used to calculate standard office thermostat temperatures was biased, and based on the resting metabolic rate of a 40-year-old man who weighs 154 pounds. Women, who tend to have lower metabolic rates, may get warmer at a slower rate and thus find that offices, in one sense, are not built with them in mind.German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends a weekly cabinet meeting in Berlin. (Fabrizio Bensch / Reuters)Today, 20 percent of Germany\u2019s corporate boardroom seats belong to women, and in a move that will increase gender diversity, the country passed a law in March instituting boardroom quotas. The law requires that companies have at least 30 percent women in supervisory seats, and German Justice Minister Heiko Maas called it \u201cthe greatest contribution to gender equality since women got the vote.\u201d Germany follows in the footsteps of Norway, Spain, France, Iceland, Italy, and Belgium, which all have similar legislation.California state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson is congratulated by senator Marty Block after her wage-equality bill was approved.

  "Other organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Facebook, and Spotify, quickly followed suit, enacting similarly generous policies.Jonathan Ernst / ReutersAlthough many large companies have announced more comprehensive paid-leave policies, many of these apply exclusively to a small subset of workers in high-paying white-collar jobs. In October, the Washington D.C. City Council proposed a law that would cover all workers and enable them to take 16 weeks of paid leave to care for a child or sick family member, regardless of where they work.Jennifer Lawrence walks the red carpet at the U.K. premiere of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.
